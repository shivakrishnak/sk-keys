# Jenkins

**TL;DR** - Jenkins is a self-hosted, extensible automation server for CI/CD pipelines - highly customizable via 1800+ plugins but operationally heavy, increasingly replaced by cloud-native alternatives (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for simpler workloads.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
CI/CD tools were proprietary, expensive, and inflexible. Teams needed an open-source automation server they could customize for any workflow - build Java, deploy Docker, run tests in any language, integrate with any tool.
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables building, testing, and deploying software through configurable pipelines. It uses a controller-agent architecture with declarative or scripted Groovy pipelines (Jenkinsfile), and extensibility through plugins.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
  agent {
    kubernetes {
      yaml '''
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: maven
              image: maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21
      '''
    }
  }
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn clean package -DskipTests'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      parallel {
        stage('Unit') {
          steps { sh 'mvn test' }
        }
        stage('Integration') {
          steps { sh 'mvn verify -Pintegration' }
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Docker') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
        sh 'docker push registry/myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      when { branch 'main' }
      steps {
        sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/'
      }
    }
  }
  post {
    failure {
      slackSend channel: '#builds', message: 'FAILED'
    }
  }
}
```

```
Jenkins Architecture:
  Controller: Orchestrates pipelines, UI, config
  Agents:     Execute pipeline steps
    - Static agents (permanent VMs)
    - Dynamic agents (K8s pods, Docker containers)
    - Ephemeral (created per build, destroyed after)

Strengths vs Weaknesses:
  + Extremely flexible (any workflow imaginable)
  + 1800+ plugins (every integration exists)
  + Self-hosted (full control, air-gapped envs)
  - Operational burden (upgrades, plugins, security)
  - Groovy pipeline syntax is complex
  - Plugin conflicts and compatibility issues
  - Security vulnerabilities in plugins
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Jenkins = self-hosted, infinitely customizable, operationally heavy. Best for: complex enterprise workflows, air-gapped environments, unique requirements.
2. Use Declarative pipeline (not Scripted) for maintainability. Jenkinsfile in repo = pipeline as code.
3. Modern alternative: GitHub Actions (simpler, managed), GitLab CI (integrated). Jenkins still relevant for complex enterprise environments.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Jenkins provides maximum flexibility via its plugin ecosystem and Groovy pipelines, and I've used it with Kubernetes agents for dynamic scaling - but for greenfield projects I recommend GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for reduced operational burden unless there's a specific Jenkins-only requirement."

# GitHub Actions

**TL;DR** - GitHub Actions is a cloud-native CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub, using YAML workflows triggered by repository events, with a marketplace of reusable actions and matrix builds for multi-platform testing.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
CI/CD requires a separate system (Jenkins, CircleCI) connected to your repository via webhooks. Configuration in a different tool than your code. Context-switching between code review and CI management.
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

GitHub Actions is an event-driven automation platform that enables CI/CD workflows defined in YAML, triggered by repository events (push, PR, schedule, manual), executing jobs on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners with a marketplace of community-maintained reusable actions.

# ArgoCD

**TL;DR** - ArgoCD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that syncs cluster state to Git repositories - Git becomes the single source of truth, with automatic drift detection and self-healing.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
CI pipeline runs `kubectl apply` with cluster credentials. Who deployed what? When? What's currently running? If someone manually changes a resource, nobody knows until something breaks. No audit trail, no drift detection.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why ArgoCD was created."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

ArgoCD is a Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool that implements the GitOps pattern: it watches Git repositories containing Kubernetes manifests and continuously reconciles the live cluster state with the desired state in Git, providing declarative configuration, version-controlled deployments, and automatic drift correction.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```yaml
# ArgoCD Application resource
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/org/k8s-manifests
    targetRevision: main
    path: apps/my-app/overlays/production
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: production
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true # Delete resources removed from Git
      selfHeal: true # Revert manual changes
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
    retry:
      limit: 5
```

```
ArgoCD GitOps flow:
  Developer -> PR to manifests repo -> Merge
    -> ArgoCD detects change (webhook or poll)
      -> Compares Git desired state vs live state
        -> Syncs (applies changes to cluster)
          -> Health check (all resources healthy?)
            -> Status: Synced + Healthy

Drift detection:
  Someone runs: kubectl edit deployment/app (manual)
    -> ArgoCD detects Out-of-Sync
      -> selfHeal: true -> reverts to Git state
      -> Alert: "drift detected on deployment/app"

Architecture:
  Git repo (source of truth)
    <- ArgoCD watches (repo-server)
      -> Compares to live state (application-controller)
        -> Syncs via K8s API
          -> UI shows sync status and health
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Git = single source of truth. ArgoCD continuously reconciles cluster state to match Git. Any drift is detected and optionally auto-corrected (selfHeal).
2. Pull-based model: ArgoCD pulls from Git and applies (vs push-based CI pipelines that kubectl apply). More secure - no cluster credentials in CI.
3. Application CRD defines: source (Git repo + path) + destination (cluster + namespace) + sync policy (auto/manual, prune, selfHeal)

**Interview one-liner:**
"ArgoCD implements GitOps by continuously reconciling cluster state to Git - I use it with automated sync and self-heal for drift correction, ApplicationSets for multi-cluster/multi-tenant deployments, and App-of-Apps pattern for managing the platform layer."

# GitOps

**TL;DR** - GitOps is an operational model where the entire system desired state (infrastructure and applications) is stored declaratively in Git, with automated agents ensuring the live system matches Git - providing audit trails, rollback via revert, and single source of truth.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Infrastructure state is spread across: Terraform state in S3, K8s manifests applied from laptops, manual console changes, undocumented kubectl commands. Nobody knows the actual desired state. Drift accumulates silently.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why GitOps was formalized."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

GitOps is an operational framework based on four principles: (1) declarative desired state, (2) versioned and immutable in Git, (3) automatically applied by agents, (4) continuously reconciled with drift correction. Git serves as the single source of truth for infrastructure and applications.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
GitOps Principles:
  1. Declarative: System described as desired state
     (not imperative scripts)
  2. Versioned: All state in Git (audit trail, history)
  3. Pulled automatically: Agents sync (not CI push)
  4. Continuously reconciled: Drift detected and fixed

GitOps workflow:
  Developer -> Change manifest in Git -> PR review
    -> Merge to main
      -> GitOps agent (ArgoCD/Flux) detects change
        -> Pulls desired state
          -> Applies to cluster
            -> Verifies health
              -> Reports status

  Rollback = git revert (simple, auditable)
  Audit    = git log (who changed what, when, why)

Push vs Pull:
  Push (traditional CI/CD):
    CI pipeline -> kubectl apply -> cluster
    Credentials in CI, no drift detection

  Pull (GitOps):
    Git <- Agent in cluster watches -> applies
    Credentials stay in cluster, drift auto-fixed
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Four principles: declarative, versioned in Git, auto-applied, continuously reconciled
2. Pull model (agent in cluster watches Git) is more secure than push model (CI pushes to cluster) - no external cluster credentials
3. Rollback = `git revert`. Audit = `git log`. Disaster recovery = point agent at Git repo. Git is the single source of truth.

**Interview one-liner:**
"GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative system state, with in-cluster agents (ArgoCD, Flux) that pull and reconcile continuously - providing version-controlled deployments, automatic drift correction, audit trails via git history, and instant rollback via git revert."

# Pipeline as Code

**TL;DR** - Pipeline as Code means defining CI/CD pipelines in version-controlled files (Jenkinsfile, .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml) alongside application code - enabling versioning, review, testing, and reuse of pipeline definitions.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Pipelines configured via GUI (clicking through Jenkins UI). No version history. Can't review pipeline changes. Can't test pipeline changes without affecting everyone. Knowledge locked in one person's head.
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Pipeline as Code is the practice of defining build, test, and deployment pipelines in declarative or scripted configuration files stored in version control alongside the application code, enabling the same software engineering practices (review, versioning, testing) for infrastructure automation.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Pipeline as Code implementations:
  Jenkins:       Jenkinsfile (Groovy)
  GitHub Actions: .github/workflows/*.yml (YAML)
  GitLab CI:     .gitlab-ci.yml (YAML)
  Azure DevOps:  azure-pipelines.yml (YAML)
  CircleCI:      .circleci/config.yml (YAML)
  Tekton:        Pipeline/Task CRDs (YAML/K8s-native)

Benefits:
  1. Version controlled (changes tracked in Git)
  2. Code reviewed (PR for pipeline changes)
  3. Testable (run on branch before merging)
  4. Reproducible (same file = same pipeline)
  5. Self-documenting (read file to understand)
  6. Reusable (shared libraries, reusable workflows)

Advanced patterns:
  - Shared libraries (Jenkins)
  - Reusable workflows (GitHub Actions)
  - Include templates (GitLab CI)
  - Composite actions (GitHub Actions)
```

2. DRY: use shared libraries (Jenkins), reusable workflows (GitHub Actions), or templates (GitLab) for common patterns
3. Pipeline changes get the same review process as application code - PR, review, merge, test on branch first

**Interview one-liner:**
"Pipeline as Code stores CI/CD definitions in version-controlled files alongside application code - I use reusable workflows for shared patterns, test pipeline changes on branches before merging, and apply the same review rigor to pipeline code as application code."

# Artifact Management

**TL;DR** - Artifact management stores, versions, and distributes build outputs (Docker images, JARs, npm packages) in repositories (Artifactory, Nexus, GHCR, ECR), ensuring reproducible deployments and supply chain traceability.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Artifact types and registries:
  Docker images:  ECR, GHCR, Docker Hub, Artifactory
  Java (Maven):   Nexus, Artifactory, Maven Central
  npm packages:   npm registry, Artifactory, GHPR
  Python:         PyPI, Artifactory
  Generic:        S3, Artifactory, Nexus

Best practices:
  1. Immutable tags (never overwrite sha256 digest)
     myapp:1.2.3 and myapp:<git-sha>
     NEVER: myapp:latest in production
  2. Same artifact through all environments
     Build ONCE -> test in staging -> deploy to prod
     (Don't rebuild for production!)
  3. Retention policies
     Keep: production releases forever
     Prune: PR/branch builds after 30 days
  4. Vulnerability scanning on push
     Image pushed -> Trivy/Grype scans -> block if critical
  5. Signing and provenance
     cosign sign -> verify before deploy
     SLSA provenance -> prove build origin

Promotion pattern:
  Build -> Push to dev registry
    -> Tests pass -> Promote to staging registry
      -> Acceptance pass -> Promote to prod registry
  (Same image bytes, different repository/tag)
```

3. Scan on push (block critical CVEs), sign artifacts (cosign), and apply retention policies (prune old builds, keep releases)

**Interview one-liner:**
"I implement artifact management with immutable image tags (git SHA + semver), build-once-promote-through-environments pattern, vulnerability scanning on push blocking critical CVEs, and cosign-based image signing for supply chain verification - using ECR/GHCR with lifecycle policies for cost control."
