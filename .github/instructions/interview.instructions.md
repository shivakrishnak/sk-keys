# Interview Mastery Dictionary - Auto-Loaded Instructions

> These instructions auto-attach when editing files under `interview/`.
> Full generation spec: `interview/_config/INTERVIEW_PROMPT.md` (v3.0)
> This file contains condensed generation rules sufficient for producing
> content after reading the full spec once per session.

## Relationship to Main Dictionary

The `/dictionary/` and `/interview/` systems are **completely separate**:

- Do NOT apply `GENERATOR_PROMPT.md` rules to `/interview/` files
- Do NOT apply `INTERVIEW_PROMPT.md` rules to `/dictionary/` files
- Do NOT create files in `/dictionary/` when working on interview content

## Workspace Structure

## Prompts (in .github/prompts/)

| Prompt                        | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `@interview-generate-entries` | Generate keyword content (keyword-batch mode) |
| `@interview-fill-content`     | Fill stubs or generate next keywords          |
| `@interview-scaffold`         | Run scaffold generator (optional)             |

## Content Structure - 19 Sections per Keyword

1. Title (`# KEYWORD NAME`)
2. TL;DR (one sentence, 25 words max)
3. The Problem This Solves (World Without It / Breaking Point / Evolution)
4. Textbook Definition
5. Understand It in 30 Seconds (One line / One analogy / One insight)
6. First Principles (Invariants / Trade-offs / Essential vs Accidental)
7. Mental Model / Analogy (blockquote + mapping + breakdown)
8. Gradual Depth - Five Levels (Anyone / Junior / Mid / Senior / Distinguished + Senior-to-Staff Leap)
9. How It Works (summarized but complete mechanism)
10. Complete Picture - End-to-End Flow (normal + failure + scale)
11. Code Example (CONDITIONAL - BAD then GOOD, production-grade)
12. Quick Reference Card (11 fields + 3 things + interview one-liner)
13. Mastery Checklist (5 indicators: EXPLAIN/DEBUG/DECIDE/BUILD/EXTEND)
14. The Surprising Truth (one counterintuitive fact)
15. Comparison Table (CONDITIONAL - 2+ alternatives + Rapid Decision Tree)
16. Common Misconceptions (min 4 rows, danger-ordered)
17. Failure Modes and Diagnosis (min 3 modes with real diagnostic commands)
18. Interview Deep-Dive (CAPSTONE - scaled by difficulty)
19. Related Keywords (prerequisites / builds-on / alternatives)

## Interview Deep-Dive Rules (Critical)

- **Minimum scales by difficulty:** easy=7, medium=9, hard=12
- Every question MUST have a **complete, detailed answer** (200-500 words)
- **Tag each question** with: `[JUNIOR]` `[MID]` `[SENIOR]` `[STAFF]`
- **End every answer** with `*What separates good from great:*`
- **Add `*Likely follow-up:*`** after each `*Why they ask:*`
- **Include timing guidelines table** at section start
- **At least 1 DEBUGGING + 1 TRADE-OFF question per keyword** (mandatory)
- **At least 1 BEHAVIORAL question for medium/hard keywords**
- Must cover at least 5 of 9 question categories

## Formatting Rules

- Code lines: max 70 characters
- ASCII diagrams: max 59 characters wide
- Paragraphs: max 5 sentences
- BAD pattern before GOOD pattern in all code examples
- Every `###` heading preceded by `---` with blank lines
- Keywords within a file separated by double horizontal rules
- No em dashes anywhere - use regular hyphens only
- Bold-label lines (`**LABEL:** value`) must each be separated by a blank line - consecutive bold-label lines merge into one paragraph on Jekyll

## Encoding Rules

- UTF-8 without BOM
- Always use `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+), NEVER `powershell.exe`
- `[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)` for file writing
- Python: `$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\python3.14.exe`
- No emojis in YAML frontmatter

## Quality Constitution (Non-Negotiable)

Full spec: `interview/_config/INTERVIEW_PROMPT.md` Section 5.
Every keyword MUST pass ALL eight quality tests before output.

### Eight Quality Tests

| #   | Test               | If FAIL                                                 |
| --- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Search Again?      | Reader still needs to look elsewhere = incomplete       |
| 2   | Feynman            | Smart beginner confused = rewrite                       |
| 3   | Senior Engineer    | Senior learns nothing new = too shallow                 |
| 4   | Staff Engineer     | Staff wouldn't respect this = lacks depth               |
| 5   | Production Reality | Can't diagnose real issue = add diagnostics             |
| 6   | Retention          | Won't remember next month = add memory hooks            |
| 7   | Decision           | Can't decide when to use/avoid = add decision framework |
| 8   | Scale              | No 10x/100x/1000x coverage = add scale analysis         |

### Code Example Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

Every concept with code must choose examples from these categories.
Choose based on concept complexity (minimum 2-3 categories):

1. Recognition Example - identify the pattern in existing code
2. Wrong vs Right Example - **MANDATORY** (BAD before GOOD, always)
3. Production Example - real-world, not toy
4. Failure Example - **MANDATORY** - what breaks, symptoms, fix
5. Debugging Example - diagnostic commands, log analysis
6. Scale Example - what changes under load
7. Trade-off Example - gain vs sacrifice in code
8. Internal Mechanism Example - how it works underneath
9. System Interaction Example - cross-component behavior
10. Testing/Verification Example - prove correctness

Goal: the reader understands why, when, failure, scale,
debugging, and trade-offs - not just the API.

### 10-Point Writing Standard

Every explanation must cover: (1) Intuition, (2) Mechanism, (3) Trade-off, (4) Failure, (5) Diagnosis, (6) Scale, (7) Decision, (8) Memory, (9) Transfer, (10) Reality

### Forbidden Patterns

- Generic textbook definitions only
- Syntax-only or toy code examples
- Vague advice ("it depends") without specifics
- Fabricated benchmarks or performance numbers
- Surface-level explanations that skip WHY
- "Best practice" claims without reasoning
- Walls of prose without structure
- Repetition across sections

### Final Gate

"Would an experienced engineer say 'Damn - this is genuinely excellent'?" If uncertain: rewrite.

## File Frontmatter Format (Jekyll/GitHub Pages - MANDATORY)

Every content file MUST have ALL of these fields:

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: "Topic - Subtopic"
parent: "Topic Name"
grand_parent: "Interview Mastery"
nav_order: N
permalink: /interview/{topic}/{slug}/
topic: Topic
subtopic: Subtopic
keywords:
  - Keyword One
  - Keyword Two
difficulty_range: easy | medium | hard
status: in-progress | complete
version: 3
---
```

Every topic `index.md` MUST have ALL of these fields:

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: "Topic Name"
parent: "Interview Mastery"
has_children: true
nav_order: N
permalink: /interview/{topic-name}/
---
```

### Frontmatter Rules (enforced)

- `layout` - always `default`
- `title` - always quoted, matches filename stem
- `parent` - always quoted, matches topic `index.md` title
- `grand_parent` - always `"Interview Mastery"` for content files
- `nav_order` - integer, unique within scope
- `permalink` - lowercase, hyphens, ends with `/`
- `keywords` - list of 3-5 items, must match `# KEYWORD` headings
- `status` - `complete` when all keywords filled, else `in-progress`
- `version` - always `3`
- File starts at byte 0 with `---` (no BOM, no whitespace)

### Pre-Commit Verification (MANDATORY)

Before every `git commit`, verify ALL modified `interview/**/*.md`
files pass frontmatter checks. See full verification command and
rules in `.github/agents/interview.agent.md` section
"Pre-Commit Frontmatter Verification". Any missing field = block commit.

### Batch Commit Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Commit every **5 created files** (never single files)
- Only commit files that were **created** (not just modified)
- If fewer than 5 remain at the end, commit all remaining at once
- Do NOT `git push`

```bash
git add interview/
git commit -m "feat: add interview <Topic> - batch <N>"
```

## Scaffold Workflow (optional)

Scaffolding is no longer required for content generation. The agent
reads keywords from frontmatter and generates content directly.
Use scaffold only to preview file structure:

1. **Scaffold (optional):** `& "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\python3.14.exe" interview/_config/interview_scaffold.py <topic>`
2. **Generate content:** Use `@interview-generate-entries` prompt or `/interview` agent
3. **Keyword-batch:** Agent generates 1-3 keywords per pass, appends to file, auto-continues

## Generation Workflows

**Existing topic:** `Generate interview mastery content: Topic: Java, File: Java - Collections.md`

**New topic:** `Create new interview mastery topic: Angular` (checks registry, generates keywords, creates files)

**From dictionary:** `Generate interview content from: tier-3-java` (scans dictionary, maps to interview topics)

## Folder/File Rules

- One folder per main topic (lowercase, hyphens)
- Each folder has `index.md` listing sub-topic files
- Sub-topic files: `{Topic} - {Subtopic}.md`
- Each file contains 5-20 related keywords
- Separator in filenames: SPACE-HYPHEN-SPACE (never em dash)

## Keyword Level Coverage (MANDATORY)

Every interview topic MUST cover ALL knowledge levels from
`dictionary/_config/KEYWORD_GENERATOR_PROMPT.md`:

| Level | Icon | Name         | Min KW | What It Covers                          |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| L0    | 🌱   | Orientation  | 3-5    | Why it exists, ecosystem, before it     |
| L1    | ★☆☆  | Foundational | 4-6    | Core vocabulary, building blocks, setup |
| L2    | ★★☆  | Working      | 5-8    | Patterns, daily usage, idioms           |
| L3    | ★★☆+ | Intermediate | 5-10   | Design decisions, trade-offs, internals |
| L4    | ★★★  | Expert       | 5-10   | Production diagnostics, failure modes   |
| L5    | 🔥   | Architect    | 3-5    | Strategy, migration, governance         |
| L6    | 🔬   | Creator      | 2-3    | Theory, specification, research         |
| META  | 🧠   | Meta-Skills  | 2-3    | Transferable thinking patterns          |

**Max 5 keywords per file, min 3.** Split into multiple files if a
level has more than 5 keywords.

**File structure per topic:**

- `{Topic} - Foundations.md` for L0 + L1 keywords (max 5)
- Core working files for L2-L4 keywords (5 each)
- `{Topic} - Architecture and Strategy.md` for L5 + L6 + META (max 5)

A topic missing any level is INCOMPLETE. Always verify before generating.

### Conditional Section Decision Table

| Section              | Include when...                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 11. Code Example     | Concept has programmatic interface |
| 15. Comparison Table | 2+ named alternatives exist        |

All other sections (1-10, 12-14, 16-19) are always required.

### Depth Calibration by Difficulty

| Aspect             | Easy          | Medium      | Hard                     |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Level emphasis     | L1-3          | L2-4        | L3-5                     |
| Code examples min  | 2             | 3           | 4                        |
| Failure modes min  | 3             | 3           | 4                        |
| Misconceptions min | 4             | 5           | 6                        |

| Comparison table   | if applicable | recommended | required if alternatives |
| BEHAVIORAL Q       | optional      | required    | required                 |

### Sizing Guide (words per keyword)

| Concept Type                  | Target Words |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| Tiny (single-purpose, atomic) | 600-1,000    |
| Medium (one mechanism)        | 1,200-2,500  |
| Foundational (multi-faceted)  | 3,000-5,000  |

### Quality Anti-Patterns (NEVER)

- Generic placeholder text or textbook definitions
- Toy code examples (counter++, hello world)
- Vague failure modes ("it might cause issues")
- Interview answers as bullet summaries (must be structured narrative)
- Shallow Level 5 that repeats Level 4 with bigger words
- "It depends" without specifying exactly on what
- Fabricated benchmarks, metrics, or incident stories

### Knowledge Deduplication (multi-keyword files)

- Each keyword answers: "What NEW understanding does THIS entry provide?"
- Reference earlier keywords by name, don't re-explain
- Ensure Interview Deep-Dive Qs are unique across keywords in same file
