# Monolith to Microservices Migration

**TL;DR** - Migrating from monolith to microservices is a multi-year journey, not a rewrite. Extract services incrementally using the Strangler Fig pattern. Start with the service that has the clearest boundary and lowest risk. Most migrations fail because teams try to rewrite everything at once instead of incrementally extracting.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
The monolith is 500K lines. Deployments take 4 hours. One team's change breaks another team's feature. Scaling means scaling the entire application even if only one module needs it. But a big-bang rewrite would take 2 years and likely fail.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Extract pieces from the monolith one at a time, like removing Jenga blocks carefully. The monolith keeps running while you build new services alongside it. Eventually, the monolith shrinks to nothing.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Phase 1: Identify candidates
  Modules with:
  - Different scaling needs
  - Different change frequencies
  - Clear domain boundaries
  - Few dependencies on other modules

Phase 2: Extract first service (easiest)
  Monolith --[Strangler Fig]--> New Service
  Both run simultaneously
  Traffic gradually shifts to new service

Phase 3: Repeat for next service
  Each extraction makes the monolith smaller

Phase 4: Eventually
  Monolith is gone (or a thin shell)
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Migration decision framework:**

| Factor           | Stay on Monolith       | Extract to Service   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Change frequency | Same as rest of app    | Much higher/lower    |
| Scaling needs    | Same as rest of app    | Different profile    |
| Team ownership   | Same team as rest      | Different team       |
| Technology       | Same tech stack        | Needs different tech |
| Data coupling    | Tightly coupled tables | Clear data boundary  |

**Extraction checklist:**

1. Identify the module's API surface (what other modules call)
2. Define the new service's API contract
3. Build the new service, implementing the contract
4. Add Anti-Corruption Layer in the monolith (calls service instead of module)
5. Run both in parallel (monolith module + service)
6. Compare results (shadow testing)
7. Shift traffic gradually (1% -> 10% -> 100%)
8. Remove dead code from monolith

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Common migration failures:**

1. **Big-bang rewrite:** "Let's rewrite in microservices from scratch." 2 years later: old monolith still running, new system half-done, team burned out.
2. **Too many services too fast:** Extracted 20 services in 6 months. Team can't operate them. More outages than before.
3. **Distributed monolith:** Services still share a database. Still deploy together. Added network latency with no independence.
4. **Ignoring organizational change:** Microservices need autonomous teams. Without team restructuring, you just have a distributed monolith.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your monolith has a tightly coupled Order and Payment module. How do you extract Order as a separate service?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical migration strategy.

_Strong answer:_

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Identify coupling points:** List every method call between Order and Payment modules. Example: `paymentService.charge(order)`, `orderService.getOrderForRefund(paymentId)`

2. **Define service API:**

```java
// New Order Service API
POST /orders          -> CreateOrder
GET  /orders/{id}     -> GetOrder
POST /orders/{id}/confirm -> ConfirmOrder
```

3. **Build Anti-Corruption Layer in monolith:**

```java
// Monolith: Replace direct method calls
// with HTTP calls to new service
class OrderServiceClient {
    Order getOrder(String id) {
        return restTemplate.getForObject(
            orderServiceUrl + "/orders/" + id,
            Order.class);
    }
}
```

4. **Handle the data split:**
   - Order Service gets its own database
   - Copy order-related tables to new DB
   - Dual-write during migration (monolith + service)
   - Validate data consistency between both

5. **Decouple Order-Payment interaction:**
   - Replace direct method call with event
   - Order publishes `OrderConfirmed` event
   - Payment subscribes and charges

6. **Traffic migration:** Shadow test (run both, compare results) -> canary (5% to new service) -> full migration

# Strangler Fig Pattern

**TL;DR** - The Strangler Fig pattern incrementally replaces a legacy system by building new functionality alongside it, routing traffic to the new system piece by piece, and eventually decommissioning the old system. Named after the strangler fig tree that grows around and eventually replaces its host tree.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Build the new system alongside the old one. Route some requests to the new system. Over time, more and more requests go to the new system until the old one handles nothing and can be turned off.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Step 1: Proxy in front of monolith
  [Proxy/Gateway] -> [Monolith]
  (all traffic to monolith)

Step 2: Build new service for /orders
  [Proxy] -> /orders -> [Order Service (new)]
          -> /everything-else -> [Monolith]

Step 3: Build more services
  [Proxy] -> /orders -> [Order Service]
          -> /payments -> [Payment Service]
          -> /shipping -> [Monolith]

Step 4: All routes migrated
  [Proxy] -> /orders -> [Order Service]
          -> /payments -> [Payment Service]
          -> /shipping -> [Shipping Service]
  [Monolith] -> decommissioned
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Implementation approaches:**

| Approach             | How                                            | Best For                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| URL-based routing    | Proxy routes by path                           | REST APIs                    |
| Header-based routing | Proxy checks header/cookie                     | A/B testing during migration |
| Event interception   | New service subscribes to events from monolith | Event-driven systems         |
| Asset capture        | New frontend captures specific pages           | Frontend migration           |

```yaml
# Nginx strangler fig proxy
upstream monolith {
    server monolith:8080;
}
upstream order_service {
    server order-svc:8080;
}

server {
    # Migrated routes -> new service
    location /api/orders {
        proxy_pass http://order_service;
    }

    # Everything else -> monolith
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://monolith;
    }
}
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Strangler Fig + Feature Flags (advanced control):**

```
Not just URL routing, but per-user routing:

if (featureFlag.isEnabled("new-order-service",
    user)) {
    route to new Order Service
} else {
    route to monolith
}

Benefits:
- Roll out per user, not per endpoint
- Internal users first, then beta, then all
- Instant rollback (toggle flag)
- A/B test new vs old
```

**Data synchronization during migration:**
Both systems need access to the same data during transition:

1. **Shared database (temporary):** Both read/write same DB. Simple but couples them.
2. **CDC (Change Data Capture):** Monolith writes to old DB -> Debezium streams changes -> New service's DB. Eventual consistency.
3. **Dual writes:** New service writes to both old and new DB. Risky (consistency issues) but simple.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: You're 60% through a Strangler Fig migration. The remaining 40% of the monolith is the most complex and tightly coupled. What do you do?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests pragmatic judgment.

_Strong answer:_

**The last 40% is always the hardest.** Options:

1. **Keep the monolith for the last 40%.** If it works, is stable, and doesn't need scaling, leave it. Not everything needs to be a microservice. This is the pragmatic choice.

2. **Modular monolith the remainder.** Refactor the last 40% into well-structured modules within the monolith. Clear interfaces, separate packages, but one deployment. Gets 80% of the benefit with 20% of the effort.

3. **Continue extraction but slower.** The last 40% takes 60% of the time. Budget accordingly. Use event storming to find the remaining bounded contexts.

4. **Hybrid permanently.** Some companies run a "core monolith" alongside microservices for years. The monolith handles tightly coupled legacy logic. New features are microservices.

**The worst option:** Force-extracting tightly coupled code into separate services. You'll create a distributed monolith with all the downsides of both.

# Re-platforming vs Re-architecting

**TL;DR** - Re-platforming (lift-and-shift) moves the application to a new platform (e.g., cloud) with minimal code changes. Re-architecting restructures the application (e.g., monolith to microservices). Re-platforming is faster and lower risk; re-architecting delivers more value but takes longer.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Re-platforming: Move your furniture to a new house (same furniture, new location). Re-architecting: Renovate while you move (new layout, new furniture).

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**The 6 R's of Cloud Migration:**

| Strategy                | What                                     | Risk    | Value        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Rehost (lift-and-shift) | Move VMs to cloud as-is                  | Low     | Low          |
| Re-platform             | Move + minor optimization (managed DB)   | Low-Med | Medium       |
| Refactor/Re-architect   | Rewrite for cloud-native (microservices) | High    | High         |
| Repurchase              | Replace with SaaS                        | Medium  | Medium       |
| Retire                  | Turn off unused apps                     | None    | Cost savings |
| Retain                  | Keep on-premises                         | None    | None         |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Decision framework:**

| Factor            | Re-platform          | Re-architect               |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Timeline          | 3-6 months           | 1-3 years                  |
| Risk              | Low                  | High                       |
| Cost (short-term) | Lower                | Higher                     |
| Cost (long-term)  | Higher (cloud waste) | Lower (optimized)          |
| Team skill needed | Ops/infra            | Architecture + development |
| Business value    | Same app, new infra  | New capabilities, scale    |

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Re-platform first:** Get to cloud quickly. Immediate benefits: managed services, auto-scaling, disaster recovery.
2. **Re-architect incrementally:** Once on cloud, extract services using Strangler Fig. Do it in sprints, not big-bang.

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**The "two-pizza" approach:**
Don't choose one strategy for everything. Different parts of the system deserve different strategies:

- Core competitive advantage -> Re-architect (microservices)
- Stable, rarely-changing module -> Re-platform (lift-and-shift)
- Commodity functionality -> Repurchase (SaaS: email, auth, payments)
- Unused features -> Retire

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Management wants to re-architect the entire platform to microservices. How do you respond?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests stakeholder management and technical judgment.

_Strong answer:_

**Don't say "no," say "here's a better path":**

1. **Agree with the goal:** "Yes, microservices can solve our scaling and velocity problems."
2. **Present the risk:** "A full rewrite typically takes 2-3x longer than estimated. 70% of big-bang rewrites fail."
3. **Propose incremental approach:**
   - Month 1-3: Re-platform to cloud (lift-and-shift). Quick win, reduces operational burden.
   - Month 3-6: Extract first 2-3 services (clear boundaries, low risk). Prove the approach.
   - Month 6-18: Continue extraction. Each quarter = 2-3 more services.
4. **Measure and report:** After each extraction, show deployment frequency improvement, scaling capabilities, team velocity.
5. **Stop when good enough:** Not everything needs to be a microservice. The modular monolith remainder might be fine.

# Cloud Migration

**TL;DR** - Cloud migration moves applications, data, and infrastructure from on-premises to cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Success requires understanding the 6 R's (Rehost through Retire), planning for data migration, security, and cost management. Most teams underestimate data gravity and network latency changes.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Moving your IT from your own servers to rented servers in the cloud. Like moving from owning a house to renting an apartment - less maintenance responsibility, more flexibility, different cost model.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**Cloud migration phases:**

1. **Assess:** Inventory all applications, dependencies, costs
2. **Plan:** Choose strategy per application (6 R's)
3. **Migrate:** Execute in waves (10 apps at a time, not 100)
4. **Optimize:** Right-size resources, use managed services
5. **Govern:** Set up cost management, security policies

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Common pitfalls:**

1. **Data gravity:** Terabytes of data are hard to move. Plan for weeks of data transfer.
2. **Licensing:** Some software licenses don't allow cloud deployment. Check Oracle, SQL Server licenses.
3. **Network latency:** On-prem services talking to cloud services across the WAN. Co-locate or decouple.
4. **Cost surprise:** Cloud is not automatically cheaper. Lift-and-shift often costs MORE than on-prem.
5. **Security gaps:** On-prem firewall rules don't translate to cloud security groups 1:1.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your database is 5TB and must migrate to the cloud with minimal downtime. How?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical migration planning.

_Strong answer:_

**Approach: Online migration with cutover window**

1. **Initial bulk copy:** Use AWS DMS, Azure Database Migration Service, or pg_dump/restore. Takes hours/days for 5TB.
2. **Enable CDC (Change Data Capture):** Stream ongoing changes from source to target during bulk copy.
3. **Catch-up phase:** After bulk copy, CDC replays changes that happened during copy. Minutes to catch up.
4. **Validation:** Compare row counts, checksums between source and target.
5. **Cutover (brief downtime):** Stop writes to source, wait for CDC to finish, switch application connection string to target. Downtime: 5-30 minutes.
6. **Verify:** Run smoke tests against new database. Monitor for errors.
7. **Rollback plan:** Keep source database running for 48 hours. If issues, switch connection string back.

# Technology Migration Strategy

**TL;DR** - Technology migration (changing languages, frameworks, or databases) should be incremental, not big-bang. Use the Strangler Fig pattern, run old and new in parallel, and measure before fully committing. Never migrate technology without a clear business justification.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Changing from one technology to another (Java 8 to Java 21, MySQL to PostgreSQL, Spring MVC to WebFlux) without breaking things.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**Technology migration types:**

| Type             | Example               | Approach                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Language version | Java 8 -> 21          | Incremental, service by service  |
| Framework        | Spring MVC -> WebFlux | New services only, migrate later |
| Database         | MySQL -> PostgreSQL   | Dual-write, CDC, cutover         |
| Protocol         | REST -> gRPC          | Add gRPC alongside REST          |
| Infrastructure   | VMs -> Kubernetes     | Lift-and-shift then optimize     |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Golden rule: Never migrate everything at once.**

```
Migration pattern:
1. New services use new technology
2. Prove it works in production (3-6 months)
3. Migrate highest-value existing service
4. Measure: performance, developer velocity, bugs
5. If positive: continue migration
6. If negative: stop, reassess
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Dual-run pattern for database migration:**

```
Phase 1: Dual-write
  App writes to MySQL AND PostgreSQL
  App reads from MySQL (source of truth)
  Compare writes for consistency

Phase 2: Shadow-read
  App reads from both
  MySQL is still source of truth
  Log any differences

Phase 3: Flip
  App reads from PostgreSQL (new source of truth)
  App still writes to MySQL (fallback)

Phase 4: Decommission
  Stop writing to MySQL
  Remove MySQL after 30-day cooling period
```

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your team wants to migrate from Java to Go for "better performance." How do you evaluate this?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests critical thinking about technology decisions.

_Strong answer:_

**Questions before approving:**

1. **What's the actual performance bottleneck?** Profile the Java service. Is it CPU-bound, I/O-bound, or memory-bound? Go helps with CPU-bound concurrent workloads but not with I/O-bound (Java async is comparable).
2. **Have you optimized the Java code first?** JVM tuning, connection pooling, caching, query optimization often give 10x improvement without rewriting.
3. **What's the team's Go expertise?** Learning a new language in production is risky. First Go service will be written like Java-in-Go (poor idiomatic Go).
4. **What's the migration cost?** Rewriting 50K LOC Java -> Go takes 6-12 months. What features don't ship during that time?
5. **One service first:** If the case is strong, migrate ONE service. Measure real production performance. Compare objectively. Then decide on wider migration.

# POC Strategy

**TL;DR** - A Proof of Concept (POC) validates that a technology or architecture approach works for your specific use case before committing to full implementation. A good POC has clear success criteria, a time limit (2-4 weeks), and tests the riskiest assumptions first.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
A small experiment to answer: "Can this technology actually solve our problem?" Build just enough to prove it works (or doesn't), then decide to invest fully or abandon.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**POC structure:**

```
1. Hypothesis: "Kafka can handle our 10K events/sec
   with < 100ms latency"
2. Success criteria (measurable):
   - Throughput: 10K events/sec sustained
   - Latency: P99 < 100ms
   - Durability: No message loss under failure
3. Time-box: 2 weeks
4. Build: Minimal producer + consumer + Kafka cluster
5. Test: Load test with production-like data
6. Decision: Go/No-Go based on criteria
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**POC anti-patterns:**

1. **POC that never ends:** "Just one more feature..." Set a hard deadline.
2. **POC becomes production:** Quick-and-dirty POC code goes live. Technical debt forever.
3. **POC tests the wrong thing:** Proves technology works with toy data but fails at production scale.
4. **POC without success criteria:** "Let's try Kafka and see." See what? Define measurable outcomes.

**What to test in a POC:**

- The RISKIEST assumption first
- Not: "Can we write a REST endpoint?" (obviously yes)
- Yes: "Can Kafka handle 10K events/sec with our schema?" "Can we migrate 5TB with < 30 min downtime?"

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**POC vs Prototype vs MVP:**

| Concept   | Purpose                     | Quality                | Lifetime  |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| POC       | Prove feasibility           | Throwaway code         | 1-4 weeks |
| Prototype | Demonstrate UX/behavior     | Functional but fragile | 2-6 weeks |
| MVP       | Deliver value to real users | Production quality     | Ongoing   |

**POC deliverable:** A document with: hypothesis, test setup, results, recommendation. Code is secondary - the decision is the product.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: You're evaluating whether to use Event Sourcing for your order management system. Design the POC.**

_Why they ask:_ Tests structured evaluation approach.

_Strong answer:_

**POC plan:**

**Hypothesis:** Event Sourcing provides reliable audit trail and enables rebuilding order state at any point in time, with acceptable query performance.

**Success criteria:**

1. Write: 1000 orders/sec sustained
2. Read: Reconstruct order state from 1000 events in < 50ms
3. Rebuild: Replay all events for a day (1M events) in < 5 minutes
4. Schema evolution: Add new event type without breaking existing events

**Build (2 weeks):**

- Week 1: Event store (PostgreSQL), Order aggregate, 5 event types, basic projection
- Week 2: Load test, snapshot optimization, schema evolution test, GDPR crypto-shredding test

**Test:**

- Load test with production-realistic event patterns
- Test projection rebuild from scratch
- Test query performance with and without snapshots
- Test what happens when projection has a bug (rebuild accuracy)

**Decision criteria:**

- All 4 success criteria met -> Recommend adoption
- 3 of 4 met -> Conditional adoption with caveats
- < 3 met -> Don't adopt (use traditional CRUD + audit table)
