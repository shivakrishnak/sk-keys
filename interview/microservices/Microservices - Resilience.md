# Circuit Breaker

**TL;DR** - A Circuit Breaker prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to a failing downstream service. It has three states: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (requests immediately fail without calling downstream), HALF-OPEN (allows test calls to check if recovery has happened). Without it, one slow service kills your entire system.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Payment Service becomes slow (30s response). Order Service keeps calling it with all available threads. Thread pool exhausts. Cart Service calls Order Service -> also backs up. In 60 seconds, every service is down because one service was slow.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Like an electrical circuit breaker at home. When too much current flows (too many failures), the breaker trips (OPEN). It prevents damage. After some time, you can test if the problem is fixed (HALF-OPEN) and reset.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
CLOSED (normal): requests pass through
  -> If 50% of last 10 calls fail
  -> OPEN

OPEN: all calls immediately fail (no call made)
  -> After 30 seconds wait
  -> HALF_OPEN

HALF_OPEN: allow 3 test calls through
  -> If 2/3 succeed -> CLOSED (recovered!)
  -> If 2/3 fail -> OPEN (still broken)
```

```java
// Without circuit breaker
PaymentResponse pay = paymentClient.charge(order);
// Waits 30s, gets timeout, thread wasted

// With circuit breaker
@CircuitBreaker(name = "payment",
    fallbackMethod = "paymentFallback")
PaymentResponse pay(Order order) {
    return paymentClient.charge(order);
}

PaymentResponse paymentFallback(
        Order order, Throwable t) {
    // Return graceful degradation
    return PaymentResponse.pending(
        "Payment queued for retry");
}
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

```java
// Resilience4j Circuit Breaker configuration
CircuitBreakerConfig config = CircuitBreakerConfig
    .custom()
    .failureRateThreshold(50)      // 50% failures
    .slidingWindowType(COUNT_BASED)
    .slidingWindowSize(10)         // last 10 calls
    .waitDurationInOpenState(
        Duration.ofSeconds(30))    // wait 30s
    .permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(3)
    .slowCallDurationThreshold(
        Duration.ofSeconds(3))     // >3s = slow
    .slowCallRateThreshold(80)     // 80% slow
    .build();
```

**What counts as a failure?**

- Connection timeout
- Read timeout
- 5xx HTTP response
- Slow response (>threshold) - often overlooked!

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Circuit breaker per-instance vs per-service:**

- Per-service: One instance failure opens circuit for ALL instances. Too aggressive.
- Per-instance: Failure of instance B1 doesn't affect calls to B2. Better isolation.

**Integration with service discovery:**
When circuit opens for an instance, remove it from the load balancer rotation. When half-open succeeds, add it back.

**Metrics to monitor:**

- Circuit state changes (CLOSED->OPEN = incident)
- Failure rate per downstream
- Fallback invocation rate
- Recovery time (OPEN duration)

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your circuit breaker is transitioning CLOSED -> OPEN -> HALF_OPEN -> OPEN repeatedly. What's happening and what do you do?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests debugging and tuning skills.

_Strong answer:_

**Diagnosis:** The downstream service is partially recovering but not fully healthy. During HALF_OPEN, some test calls succeed but failure rate is still above threshold.

**Root causes:**

1. Downstream is partially healthy (some pods up, some down)
2. Circuit breaker settings too aggressive (small sliding window, low failure threshold)
3. Health check passes but service can't handle full load

**Fixes:**

1. **Check downstream:** Is it truly recovering? Check its health endpoints, pod status, error logs
2. **Tune settings:** Increase `permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState` from 3 to 10 for better signal
3. **Increase wait duration:** Give downstream more time to fully recover before testing
4. **Add slow-call threshold:** If downstream is "up" but returning in 20s, that's still a failure
5. **Fix downstream:** The circuit breaker is a symptom. Fix the root cause (memory leak, connection pool exhaustion, deadlock)

# Bulkhead Pattern

**TL;DR** - Bulkhead isolates resources (thread pools, connection pools, memory) per downstream dependency so that a failure in one doesn't consume resources needed by others. Named after ship bulkheads that prevent one breach from sinking the whole ship.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Give each downstream service its own "pool" of threads. If Payment Service is slow and uses up its 20 threads, the other 180 threads still serve Inventory, Shipping, etc.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```java
// Without bulkhead: shared thread pool (200 threads)
// Payment slow -> all 200 threads stuck on Payment
// -> No threads for Inventory, Shipping, anything

// With bulkhead: isolated pools
// Payment pool: 30 threads (max)
// Inventory pool: 30 threads
// Shipping pool: 30 threads
// General pool: 110 threads
// Payment slow -> only 30 threads stuck
// Everything else works fine!
```

```java
// Resilience4j bulkhead
@Bulkhead(name = "payment",
    type = Bulkhead.Type.THREADPOOL)
public PaymentResponse charge(Order order) {
    return paymentClient.charge(order);
}

// Config
BulkheadConfig config = BulkheadConfig.custom()
    .maxConcurrentCalls(30)  // max 30 in parallel
    .maxWaitDuration(
        Duration.ofMillis(500)) // wait max 500ms
    .build();
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Two types of bulkhead:**

| Type        | Mechanism                    | Pros                             | Cons                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Thread pool | Separate pool per dependency | Full isolation, can set timeouts | Thread overhead             |
| Semaphore   | Counter limiting concurrency | Lightweight, no thread overhead  | Can't timeout blocked calls |

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Bulkhead + Circuit Breaker together:**

```
Request -> Bulkhead (limit concurrency)
  -> Circuit Breaker (stop if failing)
    -> Timeout (limit wait time)
      -> Downstream call
```

Order matters: Bulkhead first (protect resources), then Circuit Breaker (protect from failures), then Timeout (protect from slow calls).

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you size a bulkhead's thread pool?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests capacity planning.

_Strong answer:_

**Formula:** `pool_size = target_throughput * avg_latency`

Example: Need 100 req/s to Payment Service, average latency 200ms.
Pool size = 100 \* 0.2 = 20 threads minimum.
Add 50% buffer: 30 threads.

**But also consider:**

- Slow call scenario: If latency spikes to 2s, 30 threads handle only 15 req/s
- That's by design - bulkhead caps the damage
- Set max wait duration: If all 30 threads busy, wait max 500ms, then reject
- Monitor: Track rejection rate. If consistently rejecting, either increase pool or fix downstream latency

# Timeout/Retry/Fallback Strategy

**TL;DR** - Every external call needs three things: a timeout (how long to wait), a retry policy (how many times to try again), and a fallback (what to do when all attempts fail). Without these, a single slow or failing dependency takes down your service.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Timeout: "I'll wait 3 seconds, not forever." Retry: "If it fails, I'll try 2 more times." Fallback: "If all tries fail, return a default answer instead of an error."

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```java
// BAD: No timeout, no retry, no fallback
Product product = restTemplate.getForObject(
    productUrl, Product.class);
// Waits forever, one failure = user sees 500

// GOOD: All three
@Retry(name = "product", maxAttempts = 3,
    waitDuration = Duration.ofMillis(500))
@TimeLimiter(name = "product",
    timeoutDuration = Duration.ofSeconds(2))
@CircuitBreaker(name = "product",
    fallbackMethod = "productFallback")
public Product getProduct(String id) {
    return productClient.getById(id);
}

// Fallback: return cached or default data
public Product productFallback(
        String id, Throwable t) {
    return productCache.getIfPresent(id);
}
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Retry with exponential backoff and jitter:**

```java
RetryConfig config = RetryConfig.custom()
    .maxAttempts(3)
    .waitDuration(Duration.ofMillis(500))
    .intervalFunction(
        IntervalFunction
            .ofExponentialRandomBackoff(
                500,    // initial interval
                2.0,    // multiplier
                0.5))   // randomization factor
    // Retry 1: 500ms +/- 250ms
    // Retry 2: 1000ms +/- 500ms
    // Retry 3: 2000ms +/- 1000ms
    .retryOnException(e ->
        e instanceof SocketTimeoutException ||
        e instanceof ServiceUnavailableException)
    .ignoreExceptions(
        BadRequestException.class)  // Don't retry 400s
    .build();
```

**Critical: Only retry idempotent operations!**

```
Safe to retry: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE
NOT safe to retry: POST /orders (creates duplicate!)
  Unless service is idempotent:
  POST /orders with Idempotency-Key: abc-123
  Server returns same response for same key
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Timeout budget pattern:**

```
Total budget: 5 seconds for entire request

API Gateway: 5s total timeout
  -> Order Service: 4s timeout
    -> Inventory (gRPC): 1.5s timeout
    -> Payment (REST): 2s timeout
    -> Remaining time: 0.5s for response

If Inventory takes 1.5s (timeout),
  Payment gets 2s,
  but total might exceed 5s
  -> Need to track remaining budget
```

Each service subtracts elapsed time from the budget and passes the remaining budget downstream in a header (`X-Request-Timeout-Ms`).

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: A retry storm is bringing down your downstream service. What happened and how do you fix it?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of retry amplification.

_Strong answer:_

**What happened:** Downstream had a brief issue. 100 upstream instances each retry 3 times = 300 extra requests on an already struggling service. The retries prevent recovery.

**Fixes:**

1. **Exponential backoff with jitter:** Spread retries over time. Jitter prevents all instances retrying simultaneously.
2. **Circuit breaker:** After failure threshold, stop calling entirely. No retries.
3. **Retry budget:** Max 10% of traffic can be retries. Once budget exceeded, stop retrying.
4. **Limit max retries:** 2-3 max. Not 10.
5. **Server-side: Return 429 with Retry-After header.** Clients respect this.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

@RestController
public class OrderController {

    @GetMapping("/orders/{id}")
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "orderService",
        fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    @Retry(name = "orderService")
    @Bulkhead(name = "orderService")
    @TimeLimiter(name = "orderService")
    public CompletableFuture<Order> getOrder(
            @PathVariable String id) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
            () -> orderClient.getById(id));
    }

    instances:
      orderService:

        wait-duration: 500ms

        max-concurrent-calls: 25
  timelimiter:

      orderService:
        timeout-duration: 3s
```

**Decoration order (applied outermost to innermost):**

```
Retry -> CircuitBreaker -> Bulkhead
  -> TimeLimiter -> Actual call

This means: Retry wraps CircuitBreaker,
which wraps Bulkhead, which wraps TimeLimiter.
If TimeLimiter triggers (timeout), Bulkhead
releases the thread, CircuitBreaker records
a failure, and Retry decides whether to retry.
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Observability integration:**

```java
// Resilience4j exposes Micrometer metrics
// automatically with Spring Boot Actuator:
// resilience4j.circuitbreaker.state
// resilience4j.circuitbreaker.failure.rate
// resilience4j.bulkhead.available.concurrent.calls
// resilience4j.retry.calls[kind=successful_with_retry]

// Grafana dashboard alerts:
// - Circuit state change -> PagerDuty alert
// - Retry rate > 10% -> warning
// - Bulkhead rejection > 5% -> capacity alert

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What is the correct order to apply Resilience4j decorators and why?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests deep understanding of composition.

_Strong answer:_

**Correct order (outermost to innermost):**
`Retry -> CircuitBreaker -> RateLimiter -> Bulkhead -> TimeLimiter -> Call`

**Why this order:**

1. **TimeLimiter (innermost):** Caps call duration. Prevents thread from blocking forever.
2. **Bulkhead:** Limits concurrent calls. Rejects immediately if all slots taken.
3. **RateLimiter:** Limits calls per time window. Protects downstream from overload.
4. **CircuitBreaker:** Tracks success/failure. If failure rate exceeds threshold, short-circuits (doesn't call inner decorators at all).
5. **Retry (outermost):** If everything inside fails, decides whether to retry the entire chain.

**Wrong order example:** If Retry is inside CircuitBreaker, each retry counts as a separate call for circuit breaker metrics. 3 retries of 1 failure = 3 failures recorded. Circuit opens 3x faster than expected.

# Saga Pattern

**TL;DR** - A Saga is a sequence of local transactions across multiple services, where each step has a compensating action to undo it if a later step fails. It replaces distributed transactions (2PC) which don't scale in microservices. Two styles: Orchestration (central coordinator) and Choreography (event-driven, no coordinator).

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Order requires inventory reservation + payment + shipping. Can't wrap in one database transaction because each is a separate service with its own database. Without Saga, you get partial completion: payment succeeds but shipping fails. Money charged but nothing shipped.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
If step 3 fails, undo steps 1 and 2. Each "undo" is called a compensating action. No central transaction - each service handles its own rollback.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Order Saga:
Step 1: Order Service    - Create order (PENDING)
Step 2: Inventory Service - Reserve stock
Step 3: Payment Service   - Charge customer
Step 4: Shipping Service  - Schedule shipment

If Step 3 (Payment) fails:
  Compensate Step 2: Release reserved stock
  Compensate Step 1: Cancel order (CANCELLED)
  (Step 4 never happened, no compensation needed)
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Choreography (event-driven):**

```
Order Created ->
  Inventory listens -> Stock Reserved ->
    Payment listens -> Payment Charged ->
      Shipping listens -> Shipment Scheduled

If Payment fails:
  Payment publishes PaymentFailed ->
    Inventory listens -> releases stock
    Order listens -> cancels order
```

**Orchestration (central coordinator):**

```java
public class OrderSagaOrchestrator {

    public void execute(OrderRequest req) {
        try {
            Order order = orderService
                .create(req);              // Step 1
            Reservation res = inventoryService
                .reserve(req.items());     // Step 2
            Payment pay = paymentService
                .charge(req.amount());     // Step 3
            shippingService
                .schedule(order.getId());  // Step 4
            orderService
                .confirm(order.getId());
        } catch (PaymentException e) {
            // Compensate in reverse order
            inventoryService.release(res.getId());
            orderService.cancel(order.getId());
        }
    }
}
```

**Choreography vs Orchestration:**

| Aspect                | Choreography                 | Orchestration                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Coupling              | Loose (events)               | Tighter (orchestrator knows all steps) |
| Visibility            | Hard to see full flow        | One place shows entire saga            |
| Complexity (3 steps)  | Simple                       | Over-engineering                       |
| Complexity (7+ steps) | Event spaghetti              | Clear, manageable                      |
| Testing               | Test each consumer           | Test orchestrator end-to-end           |
| Debugging             | Correlation ID across events | Saga state in orchestrator DB          |

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Saga state machine (orchestration):**

```
STARTED -> INVENTORY_RESERVED -> PAYMENT_CHARGED
  -> SHIPMENT_SCHEDULED -> COMPLETED

Failure transitions:
PAYMENT_CHARGED -> PAYMENT_FAILED
  -> INVENTORY_COMPENSATING
  -> ORDER_CANCELLING -> FAILED

Each state is persisted. If orchestrator crashes,
it resumes from last state on restart.
```

**Semantic lock pattern:** Reserve resources with a "pending" flag. Only commit (remove flag) when saga completes. If saga fails, compensation removes the pending reservation.

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Choreography saga with 8 services is becoming unmaintainable. How do you fix it?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests architecture judgment on saga style.

_Strong answer:_

**Problem:** With 8 services, choreography creates a web of event dependencies. No single place shows the full flow. Debugging requires tracing events across 8 services. Adding a 9th step requires understanding all existing event chains.

**Solution: Migrate to orchestration.**

1. Create a SagaOrchestrator service that owns the saga definition
2. Saga definition lists all steps + compensations in order
3. Each step is a command to a service (not an event subscription)
4. Orchestrator persists saga state in its own database
5. If orchestrator crashes, restart from last persisted state
6. Full saga flow visible in one file

**Hybrid approach for complex systems:**

- Orchestration for the main order saga (8 steps)
- Choreography for cross-cutting concerns (analytics, audit logging) that subscribe to saga completion events

# Dead Letter Queue Strategy

**TL;DR** - A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) captures messages that fail processing after all retries are exhausted. Instead of losing the message or blocking the queue, failed messages are moved to a separate queue for investigation, manual replay, or automated remediation.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
When a message can't be delivered (like a letter with a wrong address), it goes to the "dead letter" pile. Someone reviews it later instead of throwing it away.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Main Queue: order-events
  -> Consumer processes messages
  -> Message fails 3 times
  -> Message moved to DLQ: order-events.dlq

DLQ processing options:
1. Alert team (PagerDuty) for investigation
2. Automated retry after fix deployed
3. Manual replay via admin tool
4. Archive (log + discard)
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

```yaml
# RabbitMQ DLQ configuration
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    listener:
      simple:
        retry:
          enabled: true
          max-attempts: 3
          initial-interval: 1000
          multiplier: 2.0

# Kafka DLQ (Spring Kafka)
@Bean
public DefaultErrorHandler errorHandler(
        KafkaTemplate<String, Object> template) {
    DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer recoverer =
        new DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer(template);
    return new DefaultErrorHandler(
        recoverer,
        new FixedBackOff(1000L, 3)); // 3 retries
}
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**DLQ monitoring and replay strategy:**

1. Alert on DLQ depth > 0 (any message in DLQ is anomalous)
2. Categorize failures: serialization error (bad message), business rule violation (valid rejection), transient error (should auto-retry)
3. Auto-replay transient errors after a delay
4. Log business rule violations for analysis
5. Fix serialization errors in producer, replay messages

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your DLQ has 10,000 messages from a 2-hour outage. How do you replay them safely?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests operational maturity.

_Strong answer:_

**NOT safe:** Dump all 10K messages back to main queue at once. Downstream can't handle the burst. And some messages might be duplicates of already-processed ones.

**Safe replay process:**

1. **Analyze:** Sample 100 messages to understand why they failed. Was it the same error?
2. **Fix root cause first:** Deploy the fix before replaying
3. **Deduplicate:** Check if some messages were already processed (idempotency key check). Remove duplicates from DLQ.
4. **Rate-limited replay:** Replay 100 messages/minute, not 10K at once. Monitor downstream health during replay.
5. **Idempotent consumers:** Ensure consumers handle replayed messages safely (same orderId processed twice = no double charge)
6. **Monitor:** Watch error rates during replay. If failures resume, stop replay and investigate.

# Health Check Patterns

**TL;DR** - Health checks let infrastructure (load balancers, Kubernetes, service registry) know whether a service instance is alive and ready to receive traffic. Two types: Liveness (is the process alive?) and Readiness (can it serve requests?). Getting them wrong causes cascading restarts or traffic to unhealthy instances.

### Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
A simple endpoint (`/health`) that returns "I'm OK" or "I'm not OK." Load balancers check it to know where to send traffic.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```java
// Spring Boot Actuator (built-in)
// GET /actuator/health -> {"status": "UP"}

// Custom health indicator
@Component
public class DatabaseHealthIndicator
        implements HealthIndicator {
    @Override
    public Health health() {
        if (canConnectToDb()) {
            return Health.up()
                .withDetail("db", "reachable")
                .build();
        }
        return Health.down()
            .withDetail("db", "unreachable")
            .build();
    }
}
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Kubernetes probes:**

| Probe     | Purpose                 | On Failure                    |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Startup   | Is the app initialized? | Don't start other probes yet  |
| Liveness  | Is the process healthy? | Kill and restart the pod      |
| Readiness | Can it serve traffic?   | Remove from Service endpoints |

```yaml
# Kubernetes pod spec
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /actuator/health/liveness
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3
  # 3 consecutive failures = restart pod

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /actuator/health/readiness
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 3
  # 3 consecutive failures = remove from LB
```

**Critical: Liveness vs readiness behavior:**

```
Scenario: Database goes down

Liveness check includes DB -> FAILS
  -> K8s restarts pod -> DB still down
  -> Restart again -> crash loop
  -> ALL pods restarting endlessly
  = TOTAL OUTAGE (wrong!)

Readiness check includes DB -> FAILS
  -> K8s removes pod from load balancer
  -> Pod stays alive, keeps trying DB
  -> DB recovers -> readiness passes
  -> Pod added back to load balancer
  = GRACEFUL DEGRADATION (correct!)
```

**Rule: Liveness checks only the process. Readiness checks dependencies.**

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Deep health checks (readiness):**

```java
@Component
public class ReadinessHealthIndicator
        implements HealthIndicator {
    public Health health() {
        Map<String, Object> details = new HashMap<>();
        boolean ready = true;

        // Check DB connection pool
        if (dbPool.getActiveConnections() >=
                dbPool.getMaxConnections() * 0.9) {
            details.put("db", "pool near capacity");
            ready = false;
        }

        // Check Kafka consumer lag
        if (kafkaConsumerLag > 10000) {
            details.put("kafka", "high lag");
            ready = false;
        }

        // Check disk space
        if (diskFreePercent < 5) {
            details.put("disk", "low space");
            ready = false;
        }

        return ready ? Health.up()

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your service has a memory leak. Liveness probe passes (process responds). How does this eventually cause problems?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of health check limitations.

_Strong answer:_

**What happens:** Memory leak means heap fills gradually. Liveness probe returns 200 (process alive). But GC pauses increase -> response times degrade -> eventually OOM kill (but before that, service is extremely slow for minutes).

**Detection strategies:**

1. **Readiness check includes response time:** If average latency > 2s, fail readiness -> remove from load balancer
2. **Liveness check includes memory threshold:** If heap usage > 90% for 5 minutes, fail liveness -> restart
3. **Custom metric-based probe:** Check GC pause time. If GC occupies > 50% of CPU time, fail.
4. **External monitoring:** Prometheus alert on `jvm.memory.used / jvm.memory.max > 0.85` -> alert team
5. **Preventive restart:** Some teams set max uptime (e.g., rolling restart every 24h) as a safety net for slow leaks
