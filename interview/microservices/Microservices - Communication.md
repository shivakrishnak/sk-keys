# Inter-Service Communication

**TL;DR** - Services communicate synchronously (REST, gRPC) for request-response or asynchronously (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for fire-and-forget and eventual consistency. Sync for queries (need answer now), async for commands (fire and handle later). Never build synchronous chains deeper than 2 services.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Sync = phone call (wait for answer). Async = email (send and continue working).

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

| Pattern             | Protocol               | Use When                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Request/Response    | REST, gRPC             | Need immediate answer     |
| Fire and forget     | Message queue          | Don't need response       |
| Publish/Subscribe   | Kafka, SNS             | Multiple consumers care   |
| Request/Reply async | Queue + correlation ID | Need answer but decoupled |

```java
// Sync: REST call
InventoryResponse resp = restTemplate
    .getForObject(
        "http://inventory/stock/" + sku,
        InventoryResponse.class);

// Async: Publish event
kafkaTemplate.send("order-events",
    new OrderCreatedEvent(orderId, items));
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**gRPC vs REST:**

| Aspect      | REST (HTTP/JSON)    | gRPC (HTTP/2 + Protobuf)         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Payload     | JSON (text, larger) | Protobuf (binary, 3-10x smaller) |
| Performance | Good                | 2-5x faster                      |
| Streaming   | WebSocket (one-way) | Bidirectional streaming native   |
| Contract    | OpenAPI (optional)  | .proto file (required, strict)   |
| Browser     | Native              | Needs gRPC-Web proxy             |
| Debugging   | curl, Postman       | Needs grpcurl, Postman           |
| Best for    | Public APIs         | Internal service-to-service      |

**The right communication mix:**

```
External -> REST/GraphQL (API Gateway)
Service queries -> gRPC (low latency, typed)
Commands/mutations -> Kafka events (decoupled)
Notifications -> Async queue (fire-and-forget)
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Avoiding synchronous chains:**

```
// BAD: 5-deep sync chain
Client -> API -> Orders -> Inventory -> Payment
                                         -> Shipping
Latency = sum of all hops
If ANY service down, entire chain fails

// GOOD: Event-driven with orchestration
Client -> API -> Order Saga Orchestrator
  Publish: OrderCreated
  Inventory, Payment, Shipping subscribe
  Each processes independently
  Saga tracks completion
```

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: A user places an order. It needs inventory check, payment, and shipping. Design the communication pattern.**

_Why they ask:_ Tests communication pattern selection.

_Strong answer:_

**Hybrid sync + async:**

```
User -> POST /orders
  -> Order Service:
     1. SYNC gRPC: Inventory.reserveStock()
        (fail-fast if unavailable)
     2. SYNC gRPC: Payment.charge()
        (fail-fast if declined)
     3. Return 201 Created to user
     4. ASYNC event: OrderConfirmed
        -> Shipping subscribes (create label)
        -> Email subscribes (send confirmation)
        -> Analytics subscribes (update metrics)
```

Why hybrid: User needs immediate yes/no for inventory and payment (sync). User doesn't wait for shipping label or email (async). Adding a new consumer (e.g., loyalty points) = subscribe to event, zero changes to Order Service.

# Synchronous vs Async Communication

**TL;DR** - Synchronous communication (HTTP, gRPC) couples sender and receiver in time - both must be running. Async communication (messaging, events) decouples them - sender publishes and moves on. Choose sync for queries needing immediate answers, async for commands and events where temporal decoupling matters.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Sync: "I call you and wait on the line until you answer." Async: "I leave you a voicemail and go do other things."

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

| Aspect       | Synchronous                | Asynchronous                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Latency      | Cumulative (A+B+C)         | Parallel possible             |
| Coupling     | Temporal (both must be up) | Decoupled (queue buffers)     |
| Consistency  | Immediate                  | Eventual                      |
| Debugging    | Easier (request/response)  | Harder (trace through queues) |
| Failure mode | Cascading failures         | Retry from queue              |
| Throughput   | Limited by slowest service | Buffered, smoothed            |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**When to use which:**

| Scenario                         | Choice              | Why                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| User needs immediate response    | Sync                | Can't leave user waiting    |
| Check stock before purchase      | Sync                | Need answer to proceed      |
| Send notification after purchase | Async               | User doesn't wait for email |
| Update analytics                 | Async               | Not user-facing             |
| Process payment                  | Sync (with timeout) | User needs confirmation     |
| Generate PDF report              | Async + callback    | Long-running, user polls    |

**Async patterns:**

```java
// Pattern 1: Fire and forget
kafkaTemplate.send("notifications",
    new OrderConfirmEmail(order));
// Done - notification service handles it later

// Pattern 2: Request-Reply via correlation ID
String correlationId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
kafkaTemplate.send("payment-requests",
    new PaymentRequest(correlationId, amount));
// Later: consumer reads from "payment-responses"
// matching by correlationId

// Pattern 3: Event notification + callback
kafkaTemplate.send("report-requests",
    new ReportRequest(reportId, callbackUrl));
// Report service generates, then calls callbackUrl
// Or: client polls GET /reports/{id}/status
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Async challenges:**

1. **Message ordering:** Kafka guarantees order within a partition. Key by entity ID to maintain per-entity ordering.
2. **Duplicate messages:** At-least-once delivery. Consumers MUST be idempotent.
3. **Poison messages:** Messages that always fail processing. Use Dead Letter Queue after N retries.
4. **Schema evolution:** Events change over time. Use Avro/Protobuf with schema registry for backward compatibility.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your checkout service calls 3 downstream services synchronously. One becomes slow (30s response time). What happens and how do you fix it?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of cascading failure.

_Strong answer:_

**What happens:**

1. Slow service response time increases to 30s
2. Checkout threads wait for 30s each (thread pool exhaustion)
3. With 200 threads and 30s waits: only 6-7 req/sec throughput (was 1000/sec)
4. All threads exhausted -> checkout returns 503 to all users
5. Cart service calls checkout -> also backs up -> also dies
6. **Cascading failure:** One slow service kills the entire system

**Fixes (apply all):**

1. **Timeouts (immediate):** Set 2-3s timeout on every downstream call. Never use default (infinite).
2. **Circuit Breaker:** After 50% failure rate in 10 calls, stop calling for 30s. Return fallback/error immediately.
3. **Bulkhead:** Allocate max 50 threads for that service. Even if all stuck, other endpoints work.
4. **Make it async:** If the slow service is deferrable (e.g., shipping estimation), make it async. Return partial response to user, fill in shipping later.

# API Gateway

**TL;DR** - An API Gateway is the single entry point for all external client requests, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, SSL termination, and protocol translation. It shields internal service topology from external clients and provides cross-cutting concerns in one place.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
One front door for all external traffic. Instead of clients knowing about 20 internal services, they talk to one gateway that routes requests internally.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Without Gateway:
  Mobile -> http://user-svc:8001/users
  Mobile -> http://order-svc:8002/orders
  Mobile -> http://product-svc:8003/products
  (Client knows 20 URLs, handles auth everywhere)

With Gateway:
  Mobile -> https://api.company.com/users
  Mobile -> https://api.company.com/orders
  Mobile -> https://api.company.com/products
  (Gateway routes, authenticates, rate-limits)
```

**Gateway responsibilities:**

- Authentication (validate JWT, reject invalid)
- Rate limiting (per client/API key)
- Request routing (path -> service mapping)
- SSL termination (HTTPS outside, HTTP inside)
- Response caching
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning
- Logging and metrics

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**API Gateway options:**

| Gateway              | Type                      | Best For                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Kong                 | Open source, plugin-based | General purpose          |
| AWS API Gateway      | Managed                   | AWS-native, serverless   |
| Spring Cloud Gateway | Java-native               | Spring ecosystem         |
| Envoy + Istio        | Service mesh ingress      | K8s, advanced traffic    |
| Nginx                | Reverse proxy             | Simple, high performance |

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Gateway anti-patterns:**

1. **Business logic in gateway:** Gateway should only do cross-cutting concerns. No domain logic.
2. **Single gateway for everything:** Use separate gateways for public API vs admin vs internal.
3. **No rate limiting:** Every public API needs rate limiting. Default deny.
4. **Gateway as bottleneck:** Must scale horizontally. Multiple instances behind load balancer.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Should authentication happen at the gateway or at each service?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests security architecture understanding.

_Strong answer:_

**Both, with different responsibilities:**

**Gateway: Authentication (verify identity)**

- Validate JWT signature, expiration, issuer
- Reject invalid tokens immediately (fast fail)
- Extract claims: userId, roles, permissions
- Forward as headers: `X-User-Id`, `X-Roles`

**Service: Authorization (verify permissions)**

- Each service checks: "Can THIS user do THIS action on THIS resource?"
- Order Service: "Does user 42 own order 99?" (ownership)
- Admin Service: "Does user have ADMIN role?"

```
Client -> [JWT] -> API Gateway
  -> Validate JWT (crypto verification)
  -> Forward: X-User-Id: 42, X-Roles: USER
  -> Order Service:
     -> Trust X-User-Id (gateway verified it)
     -> Check: order.userId == 42? (authz)
```

Why split: Gateway handles expensive crypto once. Services own their business rules. Gateway never makes business decisions.

# Service Discovery and Registry

**TL;DR** - Service Discovery enables services to find each other dynamically without hardcoded URLs. A Service Registry maintains a live directory of service instances (IP, port, health). In Kubernetes, this is built-in via Services and CoreDNS.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
A phone book for services. Service A asks "Where is Service B?" and gets back a list of healthy instances.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
1. Service B starts -> registers with registry
   ("I'm Service B at 10.0.1.5:8080, healthy")
2. Service A needs B -> queries registry
   -> gets [10.0.1.5:8080, 10.0.1.6:8080]
   -> picks one (load balancing)
3. Service B instance dies -> registry removes it
   (health check fails)
4. New B instance starts -> registers
   -> Service A's next call might go there
```

**Discovery patterns:**

| Pattern     | How                                     | Example                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Client-side | Client queries registry, picks instance | Eureka + Ribbon          |
| Server-side | Load balancer queries registry          | K8s Service + kube-proxy |
| DNS-based   | DNS resolves to instances               | Consul DNS, CoreDNS      |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Client-side discovery (Spring Cloud / Netflix):**

```java
// Eureka client registers on startup
@EnableEurekaClient
@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApp { }

// Feign client with service name (not URL)
@FeignClient("inventory-service")
public interface InventoryClient {
    @GetMapping("/stock/{sku}")
    StockResponse getStock(@PathVariable String sku);
}
// Ribbon load balances across registered instances
```

**Server-side discovery (Kubernetes):**

```yaml
# K8s Service IS discovery + load balancer
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: inventory-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: inventory-service
  ports:
    - port: 8080
# DNS: inventory-service.default.svc.cluster.local
# kube-proxy load balances across all pods matching selector
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Eureka vs K8s Services vs Consul:**

| Aspect          | Eureka              | K8s Service                | Consul          |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Registration    | App-level (SDK)     | Platform-level (automatic) | Agent-based     |
| Health check    | App heartbeat       | Liveness/readiness probes  | HTTP/TCP/script |
| DNS integration | No (need Ribbon)    | Yes (CoreDNS)              | Yes             |
| Multi-cluster   | Complex             | Federation                 | Built-in        |
| K8s dependency  | None                | Yes                        | Optional        |
| Best for        | Spring Cloud legacy | Any K8s workload           | Multi-platform  |

In Kubernetes: **don't use Eureka.** K8s Services provide discovery natively. Using Eureka in K8s is redundant complexity.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What happens when service discovery returns stale data (instance died but registry hasn't updated)?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests failure handling with discovery.

_Strong answer:_

**Problem:** Registry shows instance B1 as healthy, but B1 crashed 5 seconds ago (before next health check). Service A calls B1 -> connection refused.

**Mitigations:**

1. **Client-side retry:** If B1 fails, try B2 immediately (different instance)
2. **Circuit breaker:** If B1 fails repeatedly, remove from local cache
3. **Fast health checks:** Reduce interval from 30s to 10s (trade-off: more network traffic)
4. **Client-side health cache:** After connection failure, mark instance unhealthy locally for 30s before retrying
5. **K8s approach:** Readiness probes remove pod from Service endpoints within seconds. Combined with connection draining during shutdown.

# Backend for Frontend (BFF)

**TL;DR** - BFF is a pattern where each client type (mobile, web, partner API) gets its own API gateway that aggregates and tailors responses from backend services. Instead of one generic API for all clients, each BFF optimizes for its client's needs.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Mobile apps need small payloads and fewer fields. Web apps need rich data. Partner APIs need stable contracts. Instead of one API trying to serve everyone, each client type gets its own custom backend.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Mobile App -> [Mobile BFF] -> Order Svc, User Svc
  (small payload, offline support, push tokens)

Web App -> [Web BFF] -> Order Svc, User Svc
  (full data, SSR support, session management)

Partner -> [Partner BFF] -> Order Svc, User Svc
  (stable contract, API keys, rate limiting)
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

```java
// Mobile BFF - lean response
@GetMapping("/orders/{id}")
public MobileOrderResponse getOrder(
        @PathVariable String id) {
    Order order = orderClient.getOrder(id);
    UserProfile user = userClient.getBasic(
        order.getUserId());

    return new MobileOrderResponse(
        order.getId(),
        order.getStatus(),    // just status
        user.getDisplayName(), // just name
        order.getTotal()
    ); // 200 bytes
}

// Web BFF - rich response
@GetMapping("/orders/{id}")
public WebOrderResponse getOrder(
        @PathVariable String id) {
    Order order = orderClient.getOrder(id);
    UserProfile user = userClient.getFull(
        order.getUserId());
    List<TrackingEvent> tracking =
        trackingClient.getEvents(id);

    return new WebOrderResponse(
        order,                // full order details
        user,                 // full profile
        tracking,             // tracking history
        recommendations       // related products
    ); // 5KB
}
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**BFF ownership model:**

- Mobile BFF: owned by mobile team
- Web BFF: owned by frontend web team
- Partner BFF: owned by platform/API team

Each team controls their BFF's release cycle, data shaping, and caching strategy independently.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: When should you use a BFF vs a single API Gateway?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests architecture decision-making.

_Strong answer:_

| Use single gateway         | Use BFF                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| All clients need same data | Clients need very different payloads   |
| Small number of endpoints  | Complex aggregation per client         |
| One client type            | 3+ client types (mobile, web, partner) |
| Simple CRUD                | Rich orchestration per client          |

BFF is justified when: (1) mobile team wants to reduce payload by 80%, (2) web team wants to add server-side rendering without affecting mobile API, (3) partner API needs versioned contracts independent of internal changes.

BFF is overkill when: one React SPA is the only client.

# GraphQL Federation

**TL;DR** - GraphQL Federation composes a single graph API from multiple microservices, each owning part of the schema. Clients query one endpoint and get data from multiple services in a single request. The gateway merges subgraph schemas and routes queries to the right services.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Instead of calling 3 REST APIs to get order + product + user data, send one GraphQL query. The gateway splits the query, sends each part to the right service, and merges the results.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```graphql
# Single query, data from 3 services:
query {
  order(id: "123") {
    # -> Order Service
    status
    total
    items {
      product {
        # -> Product Service
        name
        imageUrl
      }
    }
    customer {
      # -> User Service
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Federation architecture:**

```
Client -> [Apollo Gateway / Router]
            |        |        |
    [Order Subgraph] [Product] [User]

Each subgraph defines its part of the schema:

# Order Subgraph
type Order @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  status: String!
  total: Float!
  items: [LineItem!]!
  customerId: ID!
}

# User Subgraph
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

# Gateway merges: Order.customerId -> User.id
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Federation vs REST + BFF:**

| Aspect             | GraphQL Federation                 | REST + BFF            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Client flexibility | High (query exactly what you need) | Fixed endpoints       |
| N+1 problem        | DataLoader solves it               | Manual optimization   |
| Caching            | Complex (per-field)                | Simple (HTTP caching) |
| Schema evolution   | Additive (add fields freely)       | Versioning needed     |
| Team ownership     | Each team owns their subgraph      | BFF team coordinates  |
| Learning curve     | Higher                             | Lower                 |
| Best for           | Complex, interconnected data       | Simple CRUD APIs      |

**When Federation works well:**

- Product has complex, interconnected entity graph
- Multiple client types querying different fields
- Teams want to own their schema independently

**When it doesn't:**

- Simple CRUD APIs (overhead not justified)
- High-throughput, low-latency (REST is simpler and faster)
- Team doesn't have GraphQL expertise

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you prevent the N+1 problem in a federated GraphQL setup?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical GraphQL optimization.

_Strong answer:_

**The N+1 problem:**

```graphql
query {
  orders(first: 20) {
    # 1 query to Order Service
    items {
      product {
        # 20 * N queries to Product Service!
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution: DataLoader (batching + caching)**

```javascript
const productLoader = new DataLoader(async (productIds) => {
  // Single batch call instead of N calls
  const products = await productService.getByIds(productIds);
  return productIds.map((id) => products.find((p) => p.id === id));
});

// Each resolver uses loader:
resolve: (lineItem) => productLoader.load(lineItem.productId);
// DataLoader batches all loads in same tick
// 1 batch call instead of N individual calls
```

At the federation level, Apollo Router batches entity references automatically: if 20 orders reference products, the router sends one `_entities` query with 20 IDs to the Product subgraph instead of 20 separate queries.
