# Database per Service

**TL;DR** - Each microservice owns its database (or schema). No other service reads from or writes to it directly. This ensures loose coupling, independent deployment, and technology freedom. Cross-service data access happens only through APIs or events.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Five services share one database. Team A changes a table schema for their needs - breaks Teams B, C, D. Every schema migration requires coordinating all teams. Can't deploy independently. Can't choose different database technologies per service. You have a distributed monolith with extra network hops.

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Each service has its own private database. No other service can peek inside. If you need another service's data, you ask through its API.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
// BAD: Shared database
Order Service -> [Shared DB] <- Inventory Service
  Both read/write orders table
  Both read/write products table
  Schema change = coordinate both teams

// GOOD: Database per service
Order Service -> [Order DB]
  orders, line_items tables (private)

Inventory Service -> [Inventory DB]
  products, stock_levels tables (private)

Need product info in Order Service?
  -> Call Inventory API or cache product data locally
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Implementation options:**

| Option                                 | Isolation | Ops Overhead |
| -------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Separate database server per service   | Strongest | Highest      |
| Separate schema in shared server       | Good      | Medium       |
| Separate tables with naming convention | Weakest   | Lowest       |

**Data you need from other services:**

1. **API call (sync):** `GET /products/{id}` - simple, up-to-date, but coupled at runtime
2. **Event subscription:** Subscribe to `ProductUpdated` events, maintain local copy - eventually consistent, but decoupled
3. **Materialized view:** Build a read-optimized local copy from events - best for queries

```java
// Local cache from events
@KafkaListener(topics = "product-events")
public void onProductEvent(ProductEvent event) {
    productCache.put(event.getProductId(),
        new ProductSnapshot(
            event.getName(),
            event.getPrice()));
}

// Order Service uses local cache (no API call)
ProductSnapshot product =
    productCache.get(productId);
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Reporting across services:**
Problem: Management needs a report joining order + customer + product data. With separate databases, can't JOIN.

Solutions:

1. **Data Lake / Data Warehouse:** Each service publishes events to a central analytics store. Reports run against the warehouse, not operational databases.
2. **CQRS read model:** Dedicated query service subscribes to all events, builds denormalized read models.
3. **API composition:** Lightweight query service calls multiple APIs and joins in memory. Only for small datasets.

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you handle cross-service queries when using database per service?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of the main trade-off.

_Strong answer:_

**Three approaches by use case:**

| Approach            | Use When                                   | Example                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| API Composition     | Few services, small data, real-time needed | Dashboard showing order + customer           |
| CQRS Read Model     | Complex queries, high read volume          | Search across products + inventory + pricing |
| Data Lake/Warehouse | Analytics, reporting, ML                   | Monthly sales report by region               |

**API Composition example:**

```java
@GetMapping("/order-details/{id}")
public OrderDetails getOrderDetails(String id) {
    Order order = orderClient.getById(id);
    Customer customer = customerClient
        .getById(order.getCustomerId());
    List<Product> products = productClient
        .getByIds(order.getProductIds());
    return OrderDetails.compose(
        order, customer, products);
}
```

**Trade-off:** API Composition adds latency (3 calls). CQRS adds complexity (event processing, eventual consistency). Data Lake adds infrastructure. Choose based on query patterns and latency requirements.

# Shared Database Anti-Pattern

**TL;DR** - Multiple services sharing one database creates hidden coupling, prevents independent deployment, eliminates technology freedom, and makes schema changes require cross-team coordination. It's the fastest path to a distributed monolith.

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
If two services share a database, they're not really independent. Changing a table for one service can break the other. You get the complexity of microservices with none of the benefits.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
// SHARED DB (anti-pattern):
Order Service  ---+
                  +--> [PostgreSQL]
Billing Service --+     orders table
                        users table
                        invoices table

Problems:
1. Order Service adds column -> Billing breaks
2. Can't migrate Order Service to MongoDB
3. Can't deploy Order Service independently
4. Both teams compete for DB connection pool
5. Performance coupling: heavy Billing query
   slows Order Service
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Why teams end up with shared databases:**

1. "It's easier" (short-term true, long-term false)
2. Need JOIN queries across service data
3. Transactional consistency requirement
4. Legacy migration - started with monolith DB

**How to migrate away from shared DB:**

```
Phase 1: Identify ownership
  Which service OWNS each table?
  orders -> Order Service
  invoices -> Billing Service

Phase 2: Add API layer
  Billing stops reading orders table directly
  Billing calls Order Service API instead

Phase 3: Move tables
  Create new Billing DB
  Migrate invoices table to Billing DB
  Remove invoices from shared DB

Phase 4: Eliminate shared DB
  Repeat until all tables are moved
  Each service owns its data
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Acceptable exceptions (pragmatic engineering):**

| Scenario                               | Shared DB OK? | Why                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Same team, same deploy cycle           | Maybe         | If truly coupled, might be one service  |
| Read-only reporting DB                 | Yes           | Read replicas don't affect writes       |
| Reference data (countries, currencies) | Yes           | Static, rarely changes                  |
| Truly shared entity (audit log)        | Maybe         | Consider shared schema, separate tables |
| "We need JOIN queries"                 | No            | Use API composition or CQRS             |

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your team inherits 3 services sharing one MySQL database. How do you decouple them?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests migration strategy.

_Strong answer:_

**Step-by-step migration (do NOT do big-bang):**

1. **Map table ownership:** For each table, identify which service is the primary writer. That service owns it.
2. **Identify shared reads:** Which services read tables they don't own? Build a dependency matrix.
3. **Add APIs:** For each shared read, create an API on the owning service. Example: Billing reads `orders` table -> Order Service exposes `GET /orders/{id}`.
4. **Dual-read period:** Consumer reads from API, but validates against direct DB read. Log mismatches. Builds confidence.
5. **Cut over:** Remove direct DB reads. All access through APIs.
6. **Migrate tables:** Move owned tables to service-specific schemas or databases.
7. **Handle transactions:** Where two services wrote in one transaction, implement Saga pattern.

**Timeline:** Plan for 3-6 months for 3 services. Do one table at a time, not everything at once.

---

# Data Isolation per Service

**TL;DR** - Data isolation means each service's data is accessible only through that service's API. No backdoor access via shared database, direct table reads, or database links. This is the enforcement mechanism for Database per Service.

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Your service's data is like your personal diary. Others can ask you what's in it (API), but they can't read it directly (no DB access).

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**Isolation enforcement techniques:**

| Technique                        | How                                             | Strength  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Separate DB server               | Different host entirely                         | Strongest |
| Separate schema, restricted user | Same server, different credentials              | Strong    |
| Network policies                 | Firewall rules blocking cross-service DB access | Strong    |
| Code review / convention         | "Don't access other service's tables"           | Weakest   |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

```yaml
# Kubernetes NetworkPolicy: Only Order pods
# can reach Order DB
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: order-db-access
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: order-db
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: order-service
      ports:
        - port: 5432
  # All other pods: DENIED
```

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: A data analyst needs to query across Order, Product, and Customer data. How do you provide this without violating data isolation?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests real-world data isolation compromise.

_Strong answer:_

**Options:**

1. **Change Data Capture (CDC) to Data Warehouse:** Each service streams changes to a central warehouse (Debezium -> Kafka -> Snowflake). Analysts query the warehouse, never the operational DBs. Best for analytics.
2. **Event-sourced read model:** Services publish events. A dedicated Analytics Service builds denormalized views optimized for analyst queries.
3. **API-based export:** Scheduled job calls each service's bulk export API, loads into analytics DB. Simpler but higher latency.

**Never:** Give analysts direct access to operational databases. One heavy analytical query can bring down the service.

---

---

# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**TL;DR** - CQRS separates the write model (commands) from the read model (queries). Commands modify state through domain logic. Queries read from a denormalized, optimized read store. This allows independent scaling, optimization, and evolution of reads and writes.

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Separate the "writing" part from the "reading" part. Write to a normalized database optimized for consistency. Read from a denormalized store optimized for fast queries.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Traditional (CRUD - one model for both):
  App -> [Service] -> [Single DB]
  Same tables for reads and writes

CQRS (separate models):
  Write: App -> [Command Handler]
    -> [Write DB] (normalized, consistent)
    -> Publishes events

  Read: App -> [Query Handler]
    -> [Read DB] (denormalized, fast)
    <- Subscribes to events, updates views
```

```java
// Command side (write)
@PostMapping("/orders")
public OrderId placeOrder(
        @RequestBody PlaceOrderCommand cmd) {
    Order order = Order.create(cmd);
    orderRepo.save(order);
    eventPublisher.publish(
        new OrderPlacedEvent(order));
    return order.getId();
}

// Query side (read)
@GetMapping("/orders/{id}")
public OrderView getOrder(@PathVariable String id) {
    // Reads from denormalized view
    return orderViewRepo.findById(id);
}

// Event handler builds read model
@EventHandler
public void on(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
    OrderView view = new OrderView(
        event.getOrderId(),
        event.getCustomerName(), // denormalized!
        event.getItems(),
        event.getTotal(),
        event.getStatus());
    orderViewRepo.save(view);
}
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**When CQRS is worth it:**

| Scenario                                       | CQRS? | Why                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------- |
| Read/write ratio 100:1                         | Yes   | Scale reads independently |
| Complex domain with rich write model           | Yes   | Keep write model clean    |
| Simple CRUD (blog posts)                       | No    | Overhead not justified    |
| Different read patterns (list, detail, search) | Yes   | Optimize each read model  |
| Regulatory audit trail needed                  | Yes   | Event log = audit trail   |

**The read model is eventually consistent:**

```
User places order (write) -> 201 Created
User immediately queries order -> might not exist!
  (event not yet processed)

Solutions:
1. Return the created entity in command response
2. Client-side optimistic update
3. Read-your-writes: query write DB for
   just-created entities, read DB for everything else
4. Wait for event processing (polling/WebSocket)
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Multiple read models from same events:**

```
OrderPlacedEvent published once ->

Read Model 1: Order Detail View (PostgreSQL)
  Optimized for: GET /orders/{id}

Read Model 2: Order Search Index (Elasticsearch)
  Optimized for: Full-text search, filters

Read Model 3: Order Analytics (ClickHouse)
  Optimized for: Aggregations, dashboards

Read Model 4: Order Timeline (Redis sorted set)
  Optimized for: Recent orders feed
```

Each read model is a materialized view of the event stream, optimized for its specific query pattern. If a read model becomes corrupt, rebuild it by replaying events.

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: User places an order and immediately sees "Order not found" on the order details page. What's happening and how do you fix it?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of eventual consistency in CQRS.

_Strong answer:_

**What's happening:** The command (write) succeeded and returned 201. But the event hasn't been processed yet to update the read model. The query hits the read DB which doesn't have the order yet.

**Solutions (pick based on UX needs):**

1. **Return entity in command response:** `POST /orders` returns the created order. Client displays it from response without querying.
2. **Read-your-writes consistency:** For the creating user, query the write DB for recent creates (last 5 seconds). Use read DB for everything else.
3. **Optimistic UI:** Client adds the order to the local list immediately. Background sync corrects if needed.
4. **Synchronous projection:** Process the event synchronously before returning the command response (sacrifices decoupling).

---

---

# Event Sourcing

**TL;DR** - Instead of storing current state, store every state-changing event. Current state is derived by replaying events. This gives you a complete audit trail, time travel, and the ability to rebuild projections from scratch.

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Instead of saving "balance = $500," save every transaction: "deposited $1000, withdrew $300, deposited $200, withdrew $400." Current balance = replay all events.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```java
// Traditional: Store current state
// orders table: {id: 1, status: "shipped",
//   total: 99.99}
// If status was wrong, you don't know what it was

// Event Sourcing: Store events
// order_events table:
// {orderId:1, type:OrderCreated,
//   data:{items:[...], total:99.99}}
// {orderId:1, type:PaymentReceived,
//   data:{amount:99.99}}
// {orderId:1, type:OrderShipped,
//   data:{trackingId:"ABC"}}

// Current state = replay events:
Order order = new Order();
for (Event e : events) {
    order.apply(e);
}
// order.status == SHIPPED
// order.total == 99.99
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Event store structure:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id      BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id  UUID NOT NULL,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_type    VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_data    JSONB NOT NULL,
    version       INT NOT NULL,
    created_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (aggregate_id, version)
);
-- Version for optimistic concurrency
-- Append-only: never UPDATE or DELETE
```

**Snapshots for performance:**

```
Problem: Order with 10,000 events.
Replaying all events for every read = slow.

Solution: Snapshot every N events
Snapshot at event 9,000: {status:PROCESSING,...}
Replay only events 9,001-10,000
Much faster reconstruction
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Event Sourcing + CQRS (the power combination):**

```
Write side: Append events to event store
  Events published to event bus

Read side: Subscribe to events
  Build optimized read models
  Each read model = materialized view

Benefits:
1. Audit trail (events are immutable history)
2. Time travel (replay to any point in time)
3. Rebuild projections (replay all events)
4. Debug production issues (what happened?)
5. A/B test read models (build new projections)
```

**When NOT to use Event Sourcing:**

- Simple CRUD applications (massive overkill)
- When event schema evolution is too costly
- When team has no experience with it (learning curve is steep)
- When compliance requires data deletion (GDPR - events are immutable, need crypto-shredding)

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you handle GDPR "right to be forgotten" with event sourcing where events are immutable?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests handling real-world constraints.

_Strong answer:_

**Crypto-shredding pattern:**

1. Personal data in events is encrypted with a per-user key
2. Key stored in a separate key store
3. "Forget" request = delete the user's encryption key
4. Events still exist but personal data is unreadable
5. Projections rebuilt: personal data fields come out as null/redacted

```
Event: OrderCreated {
  orderId: "123",
  customerName: enc("Alice", key_42),
  email: enc("alice@test.com", key_42),
  items: [...] // non-personal, plain text
}

GDPR forget user 42:
  Delete key_42 from key store
  Replay events:
    customerName: [REDACTED]
    email: [REDACTED]
    items: [...] // still readable
```

---

---

# Event-Driven Microservices

**TL;DR** - Services communicate by publishing and subscribing to events (facts about what happened) rather than making direct API calls. This decouples services temporally (don't need to be online simultaneously) and logically (publisher doesn't know or care about consumers).

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Instead of Service A calling Service B directly ("Hey B, do this!"), Service A announces "This happened" and anyone who cares can act on it.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
// Request-driven (coupled):
Order Service -> POST /inventory/reserve
Order Service -> POST /payment/charge
Order Service -> POST /shipping/ship
(Order knows about 3 services)

// Event-driven (decoupled):
Order Service -> publishes: OrderPlaced
  Inventory subscribes: reserves stock
  Payment subscribes: charges customer
  Shipping subscribes: creates label
  Analytics subscribes: updates metrics
(Order knows about ZERO services)
(Adding a new consumer = zero changes to Order)
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Event types:**

| Type                         | Content                                                 | Use                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Notification                 | "OrderPlaced, orderId: 123"                             | Consumer calls back for data      |
| Event-carried state transfer | "OrderPlaced, orderId: 123, items: [...], total: 99.99" | Consumer has all data needed      |
| Domain event                 | Rich business event with context                        | DDD-style, within bounded context |

```java
// Event-carried state transfer (preferred)
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events")
public void onOrderPlaced(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
    // All data in the event - no callback needed
    shippingLabel.create(
        event.getOrderId(),
        event.getShippingAddress(),
        event.getItems());
}
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Event schema evolution:**
Events are a contract. Consumers depend on them. Changing event schema is like changing an API.

```
v1: OrderPlaced { orderId, total }
v2: OrderPlaced { orderId, total, currency }

Rules:
1. Adding fields = backward compatible (v1 consumers
   ignore currency)
2. Removing fields = breaking change
   (v1 consumers expect total)
3. Renaming fields = breaking change
4. Use schema registry (Avro + Confluent Schema
   Registry) to enforce compatibility
```

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you handle event ordering when using Kafka with multiple partitions?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests distributed systems understanding.

_Strong answer:_

**Kafka guarantees order WITHIN a partition, NOT across partitions.**

```
Topic: order-events (6 partitions)

If orderId: 123 events go to different partitions:
  Partition 0: OrderCreated(123)
  Partition 3: OrderPaid(123)
  Partition 1: OrderShipped(123)
Consumer might process OrderShipped before OrderPaid!

Fix: Key by orderId
  All events for order 123 -> same partition
  Producer: kafkaTemplate.send("order-events",
    orderId, event);
  Kafka hashes orderId -> always same partition
  Within that partition: strict ordering guaranteed
```

**But:** Keying by orderId means one partition handles all events for that order. If one order generates millions of events (unlikely), that partition becomes a hot partition. For most use cases, keying by entity ID is correct.

---

---

# Eventual Consistency

**TL;DR** - In a distributed system, after a write, not all nodes/services have the latest data immediately. They will converge to the same state eventually (milliseconds to seconds, sometimes minutes). Eventual consistency is the price of availability and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

---

### Gradual Depth - Four Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
You post a photo on social media. Your friend in another city doesn't see it for 2 seconds. That's eventual consistency. The photo will appear everywhere eventually, just not instantly.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Strong consistency:
  Write -> ALL replicas updated -> Return success
  Reader always sees latest write
  Cost: Slower, less available

Eventual consistency:
  Write -> ONE replica updated -> Return success
  Other replicas updated asynchronously
  Reader MIGHT see stale data for a short time
  Benefit: Faster, more available
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Where eventual consistency appears in microservices:**

| Scenario               | Consistency | Window                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Read replica lag       | Eventual    | 10-100ms                    |
| Event-driven data sync | Eventual    | 100ms-5s                    |
| Cache invalidation     | Eventual    | TTL-based (seconds-minutes) |
| Search index update    | Eventual    | 1-30s                       |
| CQRS read model        | Eventual    | 50ms-2s                     |
| DNS propagation        | Eventual    | Minutes-hours               |

**Patterns to manage eventual consistency:**

1. **Read-your-writes:** After writing, read from the primary (not replica) for that user
2. **Causal consistency:** If A causes B, everyone sees A before B
3. **Monotonic reads:** Once you see value X, you never see an older value
4. **Optimistic UI:** Update UI immediately, reconcile later

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**When eventual consistency is NOT acceptable:**

- Financial transactions (double-spend prevention)
- Inventory count (overselling)
- Authentication (security decisions need latest data)

For these: Use strong consistency (single database, serializable isolation) or saga with compensating transactions (reserve -> confirm/cancel).

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your e-commerce site shows "5 items in stock" but when a user clicks "Buy," inventory is actually 0. How do you prevent this?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical consistency handling.

_Strong answer:_

**Root cause:** Stock count displayed is eventually consistent (cached or from read replica). Between display and purchase, other users bought the remaining items.

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimistic locking on purchase:** `UPDATE stock SET qty = qty - 1 WHERE sku = ? AND qty > 0`. If affected rows = 0, item is out of stock. Return "Sorry, item sold out."
2. **Reservation pattern:** When user adds to cart, reserve 1 unit for 15 minutes. Display "reserved for you." After 15 min, release reservation.
3. **Accurate display:** Show "Low stock" instead of exact count when < 10. Exact counts create false precision.
4. **Accept and compensate:** Accept the order, then check inventory asynchronously. If out of stock, notify customer and offer alternatives (common in high-volume e-commerce).
