# What Are Microservices

**TL;DR** - Microservices is an architectural style where a system is composed of small, independently deployable services, each owning its data and running its own process. They communicate over the network and are organized around business capabilities, not technical layers.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
A single monolithic application handles all features: user management, orders, payments, notifications, search. All share one codebase, one database, one deployment pipeline. The application grows to 2 million lines. A one-line change to search requires deploying the entire system. 30 developers stepping on each other's code. Release cadence: once every two weeks, with high risk.

**THE REAL DRIVER:**
Microservices solve **organizational scaling**, not primarily technical scaling. Conway's Law states that your system architecture mirrors your organizational structure. Independent teams need independently deployable services to move at their own pace.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Instead of one big application doing everything, you build many small applications that each do one thing and talk to each other over the network.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**Core characteristics:**

- Each service is independently deployable
- Each service owns its own database
- Services communicate via APIs (REST, gRPC) or events (Kafka)
- Each service is small enough for one team to own
- Services can use different technology stacks

```
Monolith:
  [One App: Users + Orders + Payments + Search]
  [       One Database                        ]

Microservices:
  [User Svc] [Order Svc] [Payment Svc] [Search Svc]
  [User DB]  [Order DB]  [Payment DB]  [Search DB ]
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**The three pillars:**

1. **Independent deployment:** Change and deploy one service without touching others
2. **Data ownership:** Each service owns its data store exclusively - no shared databases
3. **Business capability alignment:** Services map to what the business DOES (ordering, shipping), not technical layers (UI, logic, data)

**What microservices are NOT:**

- NOT just "small services" - a 50-line service is not automatically a microservice
- NOT SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) - though they share ancestry. SOA had heavyweight middleware (ESB); microservices prefer lightweight protocols
- NOT containers - containers are a deployment mechanism, not an architecture
- NOT required for scaling - a well-designed monolith scales further than most companies need

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**The hidden costs nobody mentions upfront:**

| Cost                    | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network reliability     | Every function call is now a network call that can fail                 |
| Data consistency        | No more ACID transactions across services                               |
| Debugging complexity    | Stack traces become distributed traces across 10 services               |
| Operational overhead    | 50 services = 50 CI/CD pipelines, 50 log streams, 50 health checks      |
| Testing difficulty      | Integration tests require running multiple services                     |
| Deployment coordination | "Just deploy independently" is aspirational; many changes span services |

**When microservices earn their cost:**

- Team size > 15-20 developers (coordination becomes the bottleneck)
- Different components need different scaling profiles (CPU vs I/O)
- Different components change at different rates
- Organization has mature DevOps culture (CI/CD, monitoring, containerization)

**Interview one-liner:**
"Microservices are independently deployable services organized around business capabilities, each owning its data. They solve team scaling by enabling independent release cycles, but trade that for distributed systems complexity."

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What are the key characteristics that make a service a "microservice" vs just a small service?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests definitional understanding beyond buzzwords.

_Strong answer:_

A microservice is defined by its properties, not its size:

1. **Independently deployable:** Can be released without coordinating with other services. If you always deploy services A and B together, they're a distributed monolith, not microservices.

2. **Owns its data:** Has its own database/schema that no other service accesses directly. If two services share a database, they're coupled.

3. **Business capability aligned:** Represents a complete business function (e.g., "order management"), not a technical layer (e.g., "data access layer").

4. **Autonomous team ownership:** One team (5-8 people) can understand, develop, test, deploy, and operate the service end-to-end.

5. **Technology agnostic:** Could theoretically be rewritten in a different language without affecting other services (because the interface is network-based).

A service that's small but doesn't meet these criteria is just a small service, not a microservice. A large service that meets all criteria IS a microservice (service size is a consequence of good decomposition, not a goal).

---

**Q2: Your startup has 5 developers. The CTO wants to start with microservices. What's your advice?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical judgment and ability to push back with reasoning.

_Strong answer:_

Strong recommendation: Start with a **modular monolith**.

**Why not microservices at 5 developers:**

1. **Team size:** 5 developers can coordinate easily. The organizational scaling benefit doesn't apply.
2. **Unknown domain boundaries:** You don't know your domain well enough yet. Getting service boundaries wrong in microservices is 10x more expensive to fix than refactoring a monolith.
3. **Velocity:** A monolith iteration speed is 3-5x faster. No service mesh, no distributed tracing, no saga choreography.
4. **Operational cost:** 5 developers maintaining 15 services = more ops work than feature work.

**Counter-proposal: Modular monolith with exit strategy:**

- Clear module boundaries enforced in code (ArchUnit tests)
- Each module owns its database tables (no cross-module queries)
- Modules communicate via defined interfaces (not direct calls)
- When team grows to 15-20: extract the first service

**Exceptions where early microservices make sense:**

- Fundamentally different tech stacks (ML pipeline in Python + API in Java)
- Strict compliance isolation (payment processing with PCI DSS)
- Wildly different scaling profiles from day 1 (video processing vs REST API)

# Monolith vs Microservices

**TL;DR** - A monolith is a single deployable unit where all business logic shares one process and database. Microservices are independently deployable services that own their data. The choice is primarily about team size and organizational structure, not technical capability.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Monolith = one big app. Microservices = many small apps talking over the network.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

| Aspect               | Monolith                                 | Microservices                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Deployment           | One unit, all-or-nothing                 | Each service independently              |
| Database             | Shared database                          | Database per service                    |
| Communication        | Function calls (in-process, nanoseconds) | Network calls (HTTP/gRPC, milliseconds) |
| Consistency          | ACID transactions (simple)               | Eventual consistency (sagas, events)    |
| Debugging            | Stack trace, step-through debugger       | Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)    |
| Team size fit        | 1-15 developers                          | 15-500+ developers                      |
| Dev speed (early)    | Fast - no network overhead               | Slow - infrastructure setup             |
| Dev speed (at scale) | Slow - merge conflicts, long builds      | Fast - teams move independently         |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**The migration spectrum (avoid jumping):**

```
Monolith
  -> Modular Monolith (clear module boundaries,
     separate data per module)
  -> Distributed Monolith (ANTI-PATTERN!
     worst of both worlds)
  -> Microservices (true independence)
```

**Distributed Monolith (the trap):**
You split into services but they still:

- Deploy together (can't release independently)
- Share a database (tight coupling)
- Have synchronous call chains (A->B->C->D, all must be up)
- Require coordinated schema changes

This gives you network latency, partial failures, and complex debugging - with NONE of the benefits.

**Signs you need to migrate away from monolith:**

1. Team size > 15, merge conflicts are daily
2. Build time > 30 minutes, CI pipeline > 1 hour
3. Release requires 2-week freeze and regression testing
4. Different parts need fundamentally different scaling
5. One team's change breaks another team's feature

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**The real trade-off matrix:**

| Requirement                         | Monolith wins | Microservices wins |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Time-to-market (startup)            | Yes           | No                 |
| Developer productivity (small team) | Yes           | No                 |
| Operational simplicity              | Yes           | No                 |
| Team autonomy (large org)           | No            | Yes                |
| Independent scaling                 | No            | Yes                |
| Technology diversity                | No            | Yes                |
| Fault isolation                     | No            | Yes                |

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you identify a Distributed Monolith? What are the warning signs?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests real-world experience with failed microservices adoptions.

_Strong answer:_

**Detection criteria (if 3+ are true, it's a distributed monolith):**

1. **Lockstep deployment:** "We always deploy services A, B, and C at the same time" - if you can't deploy one without the others, they're not independent.

2. **Shared database:** Multiple services read/write the same tables. Changing a column requires coordinating across teams.

3. **Synchronous chains:** A single user request flows through A -> B -> C -> D synchronously. If D is slow, A is slow. If C is down, A fails.

4. **Shared libraries with business logic:** A common library contains domain models. Updating the library forces all services to redeploy.

5. **Integration tests require all services running:** Can't test Service A without Services B, C, and D running in a test environment.

6. **Shared deployment pipeline:** All services built and deployed in one CI/CD pipeline.

**How to fix:**

- Define clear ownership boundaries (1 team = 1-3 services = own database)
- Replace synchronous chains with async events where possible
- Extract shared database into per-service databases with eventual consistency
- Use consumer-driven contracts instead of shared libraries

# When NOT to Use Microservices

**TL;DR** - Avoid microservices when: team is small (< 15 devs), domain is unclear, DevOps maturity is low, or the system doesn't need independent scaling. Most systems that adopted microservices prematurely ended up with distributed monoliths - all the complexity, none of the benefits.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Microservices add enormous complexity. If you don't need the benefits (team independence, independent scaling), you're paying the cost for nothing.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**Don't use microservices when:**

| Situation                   | Why not                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Team < 15 developers        | No coordination bottleneck to solve           |
| New product, unknown domain | You'll get service boundaries wrong           |
| No DevOps culture           | Can't operate 20+ services without automation |
| Simple CRUD app             | Complexity not justified                      |
| Tight deadlines             | Monolith ships faster initially               |
| No monitoring/observability | Can't debug distributed systems blind         |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**The microservices premium (what you pay):**

```
Infrastructure per service:
  - CI/CD pipeline
  - Monitoring dashboard
  - Log aggregation
  - Health checks
  - Alerting rules
  - Load balancer config
  - Container/K8s manifests
  - Service discovery registration

For 30 services = 30x of all the above

Cross-service concerns:
  - Distributed tracing setup
  - Service mesh configuration
  - API gateway routing rules
  - Schema versioning strategy
  - Contract testing framework
  - Saga/event choreography
```

**Decision framework:**

```
Q1: Is team size > 15 developers?
  No -> Monolith (stop here)

Q2: Can different parts scale independently?
  No -> Modular Monolith

Q3: Do teams need independent release cycles?
  No -> Modular Monolith

Q4: Is DevOps maturity high?
  (CI/CD, containers, monitoring, alerting)
  No -> Build DevOps maturity first, then consider

Q5: Are domain boundaries well understood?
  No -> Start modular monolith, extract later

All Yes -> Microservices might be right
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Companies that moved BACK to monolith:**

- **Segment:** 140 microservices -> monolith. "We weren't big enough to justify the overhead."
- **Istio:** Started as microservices -> merged to monolith (Istiod). Simpler operations.
- **Amazon Prime Video:** Moved a specific monitoring feature from serverless microservices to monolith. 90% cost reduction.

The lesson: Microservices is not a destination. It's a tool. If the tool doesn't fit, change tools.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: A company with 8 engineers and a 2-year-old monolith wants to "modernize to microservices." As the new architect, what's your 90-day plan?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests ability to assess and push back with a plan.

_Strong answer:_

**Day 1-30: Assess (don't change anything):**

- Map the monolith: modules, dependencies, data flows, team ownership
- Identify pain points: What's actually slow? Deployment? Testing? Scaling?
- Check DevOps maturity: CI/CD? Containers? Monitoring? Alerting?

**Day 30-60: Optimize the monolith:**

- If build time is the problem: parallelize builds, use build caching
- If deployment is scary: add feature flags, blue-green deploys
- If testing is slow: add integration test suites, test in parallel
- If scaling: add caching, read replicas, CDN before splitting

**Day 60-90: Plan modular monolith:**

- Define module boundaries (map to business capabilities)
- Enforce boundaries: ArchUnit tests, separate packages
- Each module owns its tables (no cross-module queries)
- Define inter-module interfaces (Java interfaces/APIs)

**Don't extract to microservices yet.** With 8 engineers, focus on shipping features. Extract to microservices only when:

- Team grows to 15+ and coordination becomes the bottleneck
- A specific module needs independent scaling (e.g., video processing)
- A module has fundamentally different tech requirements

Timeline for first extraction: 6-12 months, not 90 days.

# Modular Monolith

**TL;DR** - A modular monolith is a single deployable application with strictly enforced module boundaries, where each module owns its data and communicates through well-defined interfaces. It provides most benefits of microservices (team independence, clear boundaries) without the distributed systems complexity.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
One application, but organized into independent rooms with locked doors between them. You can only communicate through defined doorways (interfaces), not by reaching into another room.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```java
// Module structure
com.company/
  order/          // Order module
    api/          // Public interface (other modules use this)
    internal/     // Private implementation
    persistence/  // Own tables only

  payment/        // Payment module
    api/
    internal/
    persistence/

  shipping/       // Shipping module
    api/
    internal/
    persistence/
```

**Rules:**

- Modules only access each other through `api/` packages
- No module reads another module's database tables
- Circular dependencies between modules are forbidden
- Each module can be extracted to a microservice later

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Enforcing boundaries (not just conventions):**

```java
// ArchUnit test - fails build if violated
@ArchTest
static final ArchRule modulesRespectBoundaries =
    slices().matching("com.company.(*)..")
        .should().notDependOnEachOther()
        .check(importedClasses);

// Or specific boundary rules:
@ArchTest
static final ArchRule orderDoesNotAccessPaymentDB =
    noClasses()
        .that().resideInAPackage("..order..")
        .should().accessClassesThat()
        .resideInAPackage("..payment.persistence..")
        .check(importedClasses);
```

**Inter-module communication:**

```java
// Module API (public interface)
public interface PaymentApi {
    PaymentResult charge(PaymentRequest req);
    PaymentStatus getStatus(String paymentId);
}

// Order module uses Payment via API:
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentApi paymentApi; // injected

    public Order placeOrder(OrderRequest req) {
        PaymentResult result =
            paymentApi.charge(req.toPayment());
        // Within same JVM: direct method call
        // No network, no serialization
        // Full ACID transaction possible!
    }
}
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Modular monolith vs microservices:**

| Aspect              | Modular Monolith                    | Microservices                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Communication       | In-process method call (~ns)        | Network call (~ms)           |
| Transactions        | ACID across modules                 | Eventual consistency (sagas) |
| Deployment          | Single unit                         | Independent per service      |
| Debugging           | Stack trace + debugger              | Distributed tracing          |
| Team independence   | Module-level (good enough for most) | Full isolation               |
| Infrastructure cost | 1 app to operate                    | N services to operate        |
| Extraction path     | Easy (interfaces already defined)   | Already there                |

**When to extract a module to a microservice:**

1. That module needs different scaling (CPU-intensive while rest is I/O)
2. The team for that module wants a different release cycle
3. The module needs a different tech stack (ML in Python)
4. Compliance requires isolation (PCI DSS for payments)

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you ensure module boundaries in a modular monolith don't erode over time?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests enforcement strategy beyond "developers should follow rules."

_Strong answer:_

Boundaries erode through: developer shortcuts, deadline pressure, new team members who don't know the rules. Prevention requires automated enforcement:

1. **ArchUnit tests (build-time enforcement):**
   - Fail CI if module A imports module B's internal classes
   - Fail if circular dependencies detected
   - Fail if a module accesses another module's database entities

2. **Java module system (JPMS):**

   ```
   module com.company.order {
       exports com.company.order.api;
       // internal packages NOT exported
       requires com.company.payment.api;
   }
   ```

   Compiler-enforced boundaries. Can't even import internal classes.

3. **Separate Gradle/Maven modules:**

   ```
   order-api/     (published interface)
   order-impl/    (depends on order-api)
   payment-api/
   payment-impl/
   ```

   Compile-time dependency enforcement. `order-impl` can depend on `payment-api` but NOT `payment-impl`.

4. **Database schema per module:**
   - Each module has its own schema/namespace
   - Database user per module with access only to own schema
   - Cross-schema queries fail at runtime

5. **PR reviews with automated checks:**
   - CI label if a PR touches multiple modules
   - Require approval from both module owners

# Twelve-Factor App

**TL;DR** - The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building cloud-native applications that are portable, scalable, and maintainable. Originally from Heroku (2011), it defines 12 best practices that align perfectly with microservices: externalized config, stateless processes, disposable instances, dev/prod parity, and treating logs as streams.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
12 rules for building apps that work well in the cloud. Follow them and your app deploys easily, scales horizontally, and recovers from failures.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

| #   | Factor            | Rule                            | Bad                             | Good                                  |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Codebase          | One codebase, many deploys      | Shared repo for 5 services      | One repo per service                  |
| 2   | Dependencies      | Explicitly declare              | "Works on my machine"           | `pom.xml`, `package.json`             |
| 3   | Config            | Store in environment            | Hardcoded DB password           | `DB_URL` env var                      |
| 4   | Backing services  | Treat as attached resources     | Hardcoded Redis IP              | Connection string via config          |
| 5   | Build/Release/Run | Strict separation               | Build on prod server            | CI builds artifact, deploy separately |
| 6   | Processes         | Stateless                       | Session in memory               | Session in Redis                      |
| 7   | Port binding      | Export via port                 | Deploy to app server            | Self-contained with embedded server   |
| 8   | Concurrency       | Scale via processes             | One big process, vertical scale | Many small processes, horizontal      |
| 9   | Disposability     | Fast startup, graceful shutdown | 5-min startup, kill -9          | 2-sec startup, drain connections      |
| 10  | Dev/Prod parity   | Keep environments similar       | Dev on H2, prod on Postgres     | Same DB in dev and prod               |
| 11  | Logs              | Treat as event streams          | Write to local files            | stdout -> log aggregator              |
| 12  | Admin processes   | Run as one-off processes        | SSH into prod to run migration  | `kubectl exec` or CI job              |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Most violated factors and their consequences:**

**Factor 3 - Config (most commonly violated):**

```java
// BAD: Config in code
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    private String dbUrl =
        "jdbc:postgresql://prod-db:5432/app";
}

// GOOD: Config from environment
@Value("${DB_URL}")
private String dbUrl;
// Set via: DB_URL=jdbc:... in env/K8s ConfigMap
```

**Factor 6 - Stateless processes (most impactful):**

```java
// BAD: Session state in process memory
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("cart", cartItems);
// If this instance dies, cart is lost
// Can't load-balance to another instance

// GOOD: Externalized state
@Autowired RedisTemplate<String, Cart> redis;
redis.opsForValue().set(
    "cart:" + userId, cartItems);
// Any instance can serve any request
// Instance death doesn't lose state
```

**Factor 9 - Disposability:**

```java
// Graceful shutdown in Spring Boot
@PreDestroy
public void shutdown() {
    // Stop accepting new requests
    // Drain in-flight requests (30s timeout)
    // Close DB connections
    // Deregister from service discovery
    log.info("Graceful shutdown complete");
}
// In K8s: preStop hook + terminationGracePeriodSeconds

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Which twelve-factor principles are most critical for microservices? Which are sometimes relaxed?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical understanding vs rote memorization.

_Strong answer:_

**Most critical (never compromise):**

- **Factor 3 (Config):** Microservices must be environment-agnostic. Same artifact in dev/staging/prod.
- **Factor 6 (Stateless):** Services must scale horizontally. Any instance handles any request.
- **Factor 9 (Disposability):** Containers start/stop constantly. Fast startup + graceful shutdown is essential.
- **Factor 11 (Logs):** With 50 services, you MUST stream logs to a central aggregator (ELK/Loki).

**Sometimes relaxed (with good reason):**

- **Factor 1 (One codebase):** Monorepos (all services in one repo) work well for some orgs (Google, Meta). The spirit (version-controlled, CI/CD per service) matters more than "one repo per service."
- **Factor 10 (Dev/prod parity):** Using Testcontainers and Docker Compose gets you close, but perfect parity is expensive. The gap should be minimized, not eliminated at all costs.
- **Factor 12 (Admin processes):** In Kubernetes, you use Jobs/CronJobs. The principle (don't SSH into prod) holds, but the mechanism is different from the original Heroku model.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Microservices don't work alone. They need an ecosystem of tools and patterns: something to route traffic (API gateway), something to find services (discovery), something to trace requests (observability), something to handle failures (resilience), and something to deploy them (CI/CD + containers).

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**The ecosystem categories:**

```
COMMUNICATION          RESILIENCE
  API Gateway            Circuit Breaker
  Service Discovery      Bulkhead
  Load Balancer          Retry/Timeout
  Service Mesh           Fallback
  gRPC / REST            Saga Pattern

DATA MANAGEMENT        OBSERVABILITY
  Database per Service   Distributed Tracing
  Event Sourcing         Centralized Logging
  CQRS                   Metrics/Dashboards
  Eventual Consistency   Health Checks
  Saga Pattern           Chaos Engineering

DEPLOYMENT             SECURITY

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: If you're starting a new microservices project, what's the minimum infrastructure you'd set up before writing the first service?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical readiness assessment.

_Strong answer:_

**Before the first service (non-negotiable):**

1. **Container registry + CI/CD pipeline** - Every service must be buildable and deployable automatically
2. **API Gateway** - Single entry point, handles auth/routing/rate limiting
3. **Centralized logging** (ELK or Loki) - You'll need to debug across services from day 1
4. **Service discovery** - Services need to find each other (K8s Services or Consul)
5. **Health check endpoint standard** - `/health` or `/actuator/health` on every service
6. **Shared authentication** - JWT validation at gateway, user context propagation

**First week after first service:** 7. **Distributed tracing** (Jaeger/Zipkin) - Correlation IDs from day 1 8. **Metrics collection** (Prometheus/Grafana) - Response times, error rates 9. **Standardized error responses** - Consistent error format across services

**What can wait:**

- Service mesh (adds complexity, not needed until 20+ services)
- Event sourcing (start with simple events/messaging)
- Chaos engineering (need stable baseline first)
