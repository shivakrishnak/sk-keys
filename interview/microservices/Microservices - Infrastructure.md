# Service Mesh

**TL;DR** - A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication transparently. It provides mTLS, traffic management, observability, and resilience (retries, circuit breaking) without application code changes. The mesh uses sidecar proxies (typically Envoy) injected alongside each service pod.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Every service team must implement: mTLS between services, retry logic, circuit breaking, traffic splitting for canary, distributed tracing, mutual authentication. 30 services in 3 languages = 90 implementations of the same concerns. Some teams skip security. Some retry logic has bugs. No consistency.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
An invisible network layer between your services that handles security, reliability, and monitoring. Your code doesn't know it's there. Like a smart postal system that handles encryption, routing, and delivery tracking without the letter writer knowing.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Without service mesh:
  Service A -> (plain HTTP) -> Service B
  Each service handles:
    TLS, retries, circuit breaking, tracing

With service mesh:
  Service A -> [Sidecar Proxy A]
    -> (mTLS, retried, traced)
    -> [Sidecar Proxy B] -> Service B
  Services handle: business logic only
```

**What the mesh handles:**

- **Security:** mTLS between all services (automatic, no code)
- **Traffic management:** Canary, A/B, traffic shifting
- **Resilience:** Retries, timeouts, circuit breaking
- **Observability:** Request metrics, traces, access logs
- **Policy:** Rate limiting, access control

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Architecture:**

```
Control Plane (Istiod / Linkerd Control):
  - Pushes config to all proxies
  - Manages certificates for mTLS
  - Collects telemetry

Data Plane (Envoy sidecar proxies):
  - Intercepts all inbound/outbound traffic
  - Applies policies (retry, timeout, mTLS)
  - Emits metrics and traces
```

```
Pod:
+-------------------------------------+
| [Service Container] <-> [Envoy      |
|    :8080             Sidecar :15001] |
+-------------------------------------+
  All traffic goes through Envoy:
  - Outbound: Service -> Envoy -> Network
  - Inbound:  Network -> Envoy -> Service
```

**Service mesh options:**

| Mesh           | Proxy                 | Complexity | Best For                     |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Istio          | Envoy                 | High       | Full feature set, enterprise |
| Linkerd        | linkerd2-proxy (Rust) | Low        | Simplicity, performance      |
| Consul Connect | Envoy                 | Medium     | Multi-platform (K8s + VMs)   |
| AWS App Mesh   | Envoy                 | Medium     | AWS-native                   |

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**When NOT to use a service mesh:**

1. < 10 services: Overhead not justified
2. All same language: Shared library may suffice
3. Team can't operate it: Istio has a steep learning curve
4. Performance-critical path: Sidecar adds 1-3ms latency per hop

**Ambient mesh (Istio evolution):**
Instead of sidecar per pod, use a shared proxy per node. Reduces resource overhead from O(pods) to O(nodes). Trade-off: less isolation per service.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: You're evaluating whether to adopt a service mesh. What criteria do you use to decide?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests architecture decision-making.

_Strong answer:_

**Adopt if:**

- 20+ services, especially polyglot (Java + Node.js + Go)
- Security requirement: mTLS everywhere (compliance, zero-trust)
- Need traffic management: canary deployments, A/B testing
- Teams waste time implementing retry/circuit-breaking inconsistently
- Observability gaps: can't trace requests across services

**Don't adopt if:**

- < 10 services (library-based approach works)
- Team has no K8s operational expertise (mesh adds complexity)
- Latency-critical (1-3ms per hop overhead matters)
- All services in one language with good shared libraries

**Evaluation checklist:**

1. Install in staging, measure latency overhead
2. Test mTLS between all services
3. Test canary deployment via mesh traffic splitting
4. Evaluate operational complexity (upgrades, debugging)
5. Team training: Can the team debug mesh issues?

# Sidecar Pattern

**TL;DR** - A Sidecar is a helper container deployed alongside your application container in the same pod. It extends the application's functionality (logging, proxy, monitoring) without changing application code. The main container and sidecar share network namespace and can communicate via localhost.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Like a motorcycle sidecar - a separate vehicle attached to the main one, providing extra functionality (carrying a passenger) without modifying the motorcycle itself.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```yaml
# Kubernetes pod with sidecar
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app # Main container
      image: order-service:v2
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    - name: envoy-sidecar # Sidecar
      image: envoyproxy/envoy:v1.28
      ports:
        - containerPort: 15001
    - name: log-collector # Another sidecar
      image: fluentd:v1.16
      # Reads logs from shared volume
  volumes:
    - name: logs
      emptyDir: {}
```

**Common sidecar use cases:**

| Sidecar          | Purpose                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Envoy proxy      | mTLS, traffic management, tracing     |
| Fluentd/Filebeat | Log collection and forwarding         |
| Vault agent      | Secret injection from HashiCorp Vault |
| CloudSQL proxy   | Secure DB connection (GCP)            |
| Config watcher   | Hot-reload config from ConfigMap      |

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Why sidecar instead of library?**

| Aspect             | Library                         | Sidecar                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Language coupling  | Yes (Java library for Java app) | No (any language)          |
| Update mechanism   | Redeploy all services           | Update sidecar image only  |
| Resource isolation | Shared with app                 | Separate CPU/memory limits |
| Failure isolation  | Crashes take down app           | Can restart independently  |
| Complexity         | In-process                      | Network hop (localhost)    |

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Sidecar lifecycle management:**

```yaml
# Kubernetes 1.28+: native sidecar containers
# Guaranteed to start before and stop after
# the main container
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: envoy
      image: envoyproxy/envoy:v1.28
      restartPolicy: Always # <- Makes it a sidecar
      # Starts before main container
      # Stops after main container exits
```

Before native sidecar support, the ordering problem was real: main container might start before Envoy is ready, causing initial requests to fail.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What are the downsides of the sidecar pattern?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests awareness of trade-offs.

_Strong answer:_

1. **Resource overhead:** Each pod has an extra container consuming CPU and memory. 1000 pods \* 100MB sidecar = 100GB extra memory.
2. **Latency:** localhost hop adds ~1ms per request. For internal gRPC at 0.5ms, that's a 200% increase.
3. **Startup ordering:** Main container might start before sidecar is ready. Need init containers or readiness gates.
4. **Debugging complexity:** Is the problem in the app or the sidecar? Adds another layer to diagnose.
5. **Upgrade coordination:** Sidecar version must be compatible with control plane. Mass upgrade across 1000 pods.

**Mitigations:** Native sidecar containers (K8s 1.28+), ambient mesh (shared proxy per node instead of per pod), right-sizing sidecar resources.

# Istio

**TL;DR** - Istio is the most feature-rich service mesh for Kubernetes. It provides mTLS, traffic management (canary, A/B, fault injection), observability (metrics, traces, access logs), and security policies. It uses Envoy as its data plane proxy and Istiod as the control plane.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
Istio is the "operating system" for microservices networking. Install it in your Kubernetes cluster and every service automatically gets encryption, traffic control, and monitoring.

```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Istio traffic management features:**

| Feature           | Use Case                       | Config Resource |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |

| Retries           | Automatic retry on failure     | VirtualService  |
| Timeouts          | Request timeout enforcement    | VirtualService  |
| Rate limiting     | Protect services from overload | EnvoyFilter     |

```yaml
# Fault injection for chaos testing

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What's the operational overhead of running Istio in production?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests real-world experience.

_Strong answer:_

**Overhead areas:**

1. **Resource:** Istiod control plane (~1 CPU, 2GB RAM). Envoy sidecar per pod (~100MB RAM, 50m CPU). 500 pods = 50GB extra RAM.
2. **Latency:** ~2-3ms added per hop (Envoy proxy processing). Acceptable for most services, problematic for sub-millisecond requirements.
3. **Upgrades:** Istio releases every ~3 months. Upgrade requires rolling restart of all sidecars. Plan for maintenance windows.
4. **Debugging:** When something breaks, is it the app, Envoy, or Istio config? Need istioctl, envoy admin API, and deep K8s knowledge.
5. **Configuration complexity:** VirtualService, DestinationRule, PeerAuthentication, AuthorizationPolicy, EnvoyFilter - steep learning curve.

**Mitigation:** Start with core features only (mTLS + observability). Add traffic management when needed. Don't enable everything at once.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
A smart traffic cop that sits between services and handles routing, security, and monitoring. Your application sends traffic to Envoy (localhost), and Envoy handles the rest.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
App -> localhost:15001 (Envoy)
  -> Envoy handles:
     - TLS encryption
     - Load balancing (round robin, least connections)
     - Retry on failure
     - Circuit breaking
     - Emit request metrics + traces
  -> Upstream service
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Envoy architecture:**

```
Listeners -> Filter Chains -> Clusters
  (ports)    (processing)     (upstream groups)

Listener :8080
  -> HTTP Connection Manager (filter)
    -> Router (filter)
      -> Cluster: order-service
        -> Endpoints: 10.0.1.5:8080, 10.0.1.6:8080
```

**Key Envoy features:**

- **Hot reload:** Config changes without restart
- **xDS API:** Dynamic configuration from control plane
- **Health checking:** Active + passive (outlier detection)
- **Circuit breaking:** Max connections, max pending, max retries per cluster
- **Load balancing:** Round robin, least request, random, ring hash (consistent hashing)

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Envoy as API Gateway (standalone, without Istio):**

```yaml
# envoy.yaml - standalone edge proxy
static_resources:
  listeners:
    - address:
        socket_address:
          address: 0.0.0.0
          port_value: 8443
      filter_chains:
        - transport_socket:
            name: envoy.transport_sockets.tls
            typed_config:

                    private_key:
                      filename: /certs/key.pem
          filters:
            - name: envoy.filters.network
                .http_connection_manager
              typed_config:
                route_config:
                  virtual_hosts:
                    - name: api
                      routes:
                        - match:
                            prefix: "/orders"
                          route:
                            cluster: order-service
                        - match:
                            prefix: "/products"
                          route:

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Why is Envoy preferred over Nginx for service mesh use cases?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of proxy architecture.

_Strong answer:_

| Aspect            | Envoy                                    | Nginx                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Configuration     | Dynamic (xDS API, no restart)            | Static (config file, needs reload) |
| L7 protocols      | HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC, WebSocket native | HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 (gRPC via module) |
| Observability     | Built-in metrics, tracing, access logs   | Basic access logs, needs modules   |
| Service discovery | Native (EDS API)                         | Needs commercial Plus or scripting |
| Programmability   | Filter chains, WASM extensions           | Lua scripting, OpenResty           |
| Designed for      | Microservices, service mesh              | Web serving, reverse proxy         |

Envoy was designed from the ground up for dynamic, API-driven microservices. Nginx was designed for static web serving and adapted for dynamic use cases.

# Platform Engineering

**TL;DR** - Platform Engineering builds an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that provides self-service infrastructure to product teams. Instead of every team configuring Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability, and security individually, the platform team provides golden paths: opinionated, automated workflows that make doing the right thing the easy thing.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
A platform team builds the "developer highway" so product teams don't have to build their own roads. Developers get self-service tools to deploy, monitor, and manage services without becoming infrastructure experts.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

```
Without platform:
  Dev: "I need a new service"
  -> Open Jira ticket to Ops
  -> Wait 2 weeks for K8s namespace, CI pipeline,
     monitoring, DNS, TLS cert
  -> Manual setup prone to errors

With platform:
  Dev: "I need a new service"
  -> Run: platform create-service order-service
  -> Gets: K8s namespace, CI/CD pipeline,
     Grafana dashboard, TLS cert, DNS entry
  -> 10 minutes, fully automated
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**IDP components:**

| Component       | Purpose                         | Tools                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Service catalog | List all services + ownership   | Backstage, Port                           |
| Templates       | Scaffold new services           | Cookiecutter, Yeoman, Backstage templates |
| CI/CD           | Automated build + deploy        | ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Tekton            |
| Infrastructure  | Self-service infra provisioning | Terraform, Crossplane                     |
| Observability   | Pre-configured dashboards       | Grafana, Datadog                          |
| Security        | Automated scanning, secrets     | Vault, Trivy, OPA/Gatekeeper              |
| Documentation   | Auto-generated API docs         | Backstage TechDocs                        |

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Platform team anti-patterns:**

1. **Ticket Ops:** Platform team becomes a ticket queue. Defeats self-service purpose.
2. **Mandated platform:** Force teams to use platform with no escape hatch. Some teams have legitimate exceptions.
3. **Gold-plating:** Building features no one asked for. Build for the 80% use case.
4. **No product mindset:** Platform team doesn't treat developers as customers. No feedback loops, no user research.

**Platform as a product:**

- Treat internal developers as customers
- Measure: time-to-first-deploy, DORA metrics improvement
- User research: survey developers quarterly
- Roadmap: prioritize based on developer pain points

_Why they ask:_ Tests product thinking applied to infrastructure.

_Strong answer:_

**Metrics:**

1. **Time-to-first-deploy:** How long from "new service idea" to first production deployment? Target: < 1 day.
2. **DORA metrics improvement:** Deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, MTTR - should all improve.
3. **Self-service ratio:** What percentage of infrastructure requests are handled without a ticket? Target: > 80%.
4. **Developer satisfaction (NPS):** Survey quarterly. "Would you recommend the platform to a colleague?"
5. **Cognitive load:** How many tools/systems must a developer understand to deploy? Should decrease over time.
6. **Onboarding time:** How long for a new engineer to deploy their first change? Target: < 1 day.

# Multi-Tenancy

**TL;DR** - Multi-tenancy is serving multiple customers (tenants) from a single deployment of the application. Tenant data is isolated (logically or physically), but infrastructure is shared to reduce costs. Three models: shared everything, shared app/separate DB, and separate everything.

### 📶 Gradual Depth - Five Levels

**Level 1 - What it is (anyone can understand):**
One apartment building (application) with many tenants (customers). Each has their own private unit (data), shares the hallways and elevators (infrastructure). Cheaper than building a separate house for each.

**Level 2 - How to use it (junior developer):**

**Multi-tenancy models:**

| Model                      | Data Isolation               | Cost    | Complexity |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Shared DB, shared schema   | Row-level (tenant_id column) | Lowest  | Lowest     |
| Shared DB, separate schema | Schema-level                 | Medium  | Medium     |
| Separate DB per tenant     | Database-level               | Highest | Highest    |

```java
// Shared schema: tenant_id on every table
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id private Long id;
    @Column private String tenantId; // every row
    private BigDecimal total;
}

// Every query MUST filter by tenantId
@Query("SELECT o FROM Order o "
    + "WHERE o.tenantId = :tenantId")
List<Order> findByTenant(
    @Param("tenantId") String tenantId);

// SECURITY CRITICAL: If you forget tenantId filter,
// tenant A sees tenant B's data!
```

**Level 3 - How it works (mid-level engineer):**

**Tenant context propagation:**

```java
// Tenant resolved from JWT, API key, or subdomain
@Component
public class TenantFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req,
            ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain) {
        String tenantId = extractTenant(
            (HttpServletRequest) req);
        TenantContext.set(tenantId);
        try {
            chain.doFilter(req, res);
        } finally {
            TenantContext.clear();
        }
    }
}

// Hibernate filter auto-applies tenant filter
@FilterDef(name = "tenantFilter",
    parameters = @ParamDef(
        name = "tenantId", type = String.class))
@Filter(name = "tenantFilter",
    condition = "tenant_id = :tenantId")
@Entity
public class Order { }

// Every query automatically includes:
// WHERE tenant_id = 'tenant-abc'
// Even if developer forgets to add it!
```

**Level 4 - Mastery (senior/staff+ engineer):**

**Noisy neighbor problem:**
One tenant generates 10x more load than others. They consume all database connections, CPU, and memory. Other tenants experience degradation.

**Solutions:**

1. **Per-tenant rate limiting:** Max 1000 req/min per tenant
2. **Resource quotas:** Per-tenant connection pool limits
3. **Tenant tiers:** Premium tenants get dedicated resources. Free tenants share.
4. **Shard by tenant:** High-volume tenants get their own database shard

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: A bug in your multi-tenant application exposed Tenant A's data to Tenant B. How do you prevent this?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests security awareness.

_Strong answer:_

**Prevention layers (defense in depth):**

1. **Automatic query filtering:** Use Hibernate filters or PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) so every query automatically includes `WHERE tenant_id = ?`. Developers can't forget.

2. **Row-Level Security (database level):**

```sql
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON orders
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting(
    'app.current_tenant'));
-- Database enforces isolation even if app has bugs
```

3. **Integration tests:** Test that Tenant A's API calls never return Tenant B's data. Run for every endpoint.

4. **Audit logging:** Log every data access with tenant context. Alert if a request accesses data for a tenant different from the authenticated tenant.

5. **Separate schemas or databases:** For highest-security tenants (enterprise, regulated industries), use separate schemas. Physical isolation eliminates cross-tenant bugs.
