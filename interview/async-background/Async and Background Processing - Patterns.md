# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

**TL;DR** - Event-Driven Architecture structures applications around producing, detecting, and reacting to events, decoupling components so they communicate through events rather than direct calls.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT EDA:**
Order service calls shipping service (HTTP). Shipping service calls inventory service. Inventory service calls notification service. Each call is synchronous. If shipping is down, order fails. If inventory is slow, everything is slow. Adding a new analytics service means modifying the order service to call it. Every service knows about every other service.

**THE KEY INSIGHT:**
"Order placed" is a fact about the world. Multiple services need to react to this fact. The order service shouldn't know or care who reacts. It should announce the event and move on.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
TRADITIONAL (request-driven):
[Order] -> HTTP -> [Shipping]
       -> HTTP -> [Inventory]
       -> HTTP -> [Notification]
       -> HTTP -> [Analytics]
  Order knows all downstream services

EVENT-DRIVEN:
[Order] -> publishes -> [OrderCreated event]
                            |
              +------+------+------+
              |      |      |      |
          [Shipping] [Inv] [Notif] [Analytics]
              (subscribe independently)
  Order knows nothing about consumers
```

**Three styles:**

1. **Event Notification:** "Something happened." Consumers query for details. Minimal coupling.
2. **Event-Carried State Transfer:** Event contains all data consumers need. No callback queries.
3. **Event Sourcing:** Events are the source of truth. Current state is derived by replaying events.

public record OrderCreatedEvent(

    List<LineItem> items, BigDecimal total,
    Instant timestamp) {}

// Producer: publishes event, doesn't know consumers
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, Object> kafka;

    @Transactional
    public Order createOrder(CreateOrderCommand cmd) {
        Order order = Order.from(cmd);
        orderRepo.save(order);
        kafka.send("order-events",
            order.getId(),
            new OrderCreatedEvent(order));
        return order;
    }
}

// Consumers: independent, decoupled
@Component
public class ShippingEventHandler {
    @KafkaListener(topics = "order-events",
        groupId = "shipping")
    public void handle(OrderCreatedEvent event) {

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What are the challenges of Event-Driven Architecture?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests awareness of trade-offs beyond the happy path.

**Answer:**

1. **Debugging complexity:** No single request/response trace. Event flows span multiple services asynchronously. Solution: distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin) with correlation IDs.

2. **Eventual consistency:** After publishing an event, consumers haven't processed it yet. The order service shows "created" while shipping still doesn't know. Solution: design UIs to show pending states.

3. **Event ordering:** If "order updated" arrives before "order created," consumers break. Solution: partition by entity ID (all events for order-123 go to same partition, preserving order).

4. **Schema evolution:** Changing event structure breaks consumers. Solution: schema registry (Avro, Protobuf) with backward/forward compatibility.

5. **Debugging "who consumes what":** No single place shows all consumers of an event. Solution: event catalog, AsyncAPI documentation, consumer registration.

# Saga Pattern

**TL;DR** - Saga manages distributed transactions across multiple services by breaking them into a sequence of local transactions, each with a compensating action for rollback.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT SAGA:**
Order processing spans 4 services: create order, reserve inventory, charge payment, schedule shipping. If payment fails after inventory is reserved, you need to undo the reservation. In a monolith, a database transaction handles this. In microservices, there's no distributed transaction (2PC is too slow). How do you ensure all-or-nothing across services?

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
CHOREOGRAPHY (event-driven):
[Order] -> OrderCreated event
  -> [Inventory] reserves stock
    -> StockReserved event
      -> [Payment] charges card
        -> PaymentCharged event
          -> [Shipping] schedules delivery

COMPENSATION (on failure):
[Payment] fails -> PaymentFailed event
  -> [Inventory] releases stock (compensate)
  -> [Order] marks as failed (compensate)

ORCHESTRATION (central coordinator):
[Saga Orchestrator]
  -> Step 1: Create order
  -> Step 2: Reserve inventory
  -> Step 3: Charge payment (FAILS)
  -> Compensate Step 2: Release inventory
  -> Compensate Step 1: Cancel order
```

**Two approaches:**

| Aspect               | Choreography            | Orchestration         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Coordination         | Events between services | Central orchestrator  |
| Coupling             | Lower                   | Higher (orchestrator) |
| Visibility           | Hard to see full flow   | Clear in orchestrator |
| Complexity           | Simple for 3-4 steps    | Better for 5+ steps   |
| Single failure point | No                      | Orchestrator          |

            // Step 2: Reserve inventory
            inventoryService.reserve(
                order.getItems());
            try {
                // Step 3: Charge payment
                paymentService.charge(
                    order.getUserId(),
                    order.getTotal());
                // Step 4: Schedule shipping
                shippingService.schedule(order);
                return OrderResult.success(order);
            } catch (PaymentException e) {
                // Compensate Step 2
                inventoryService.release(
                    order.getItems());
                order.markFailed("Payment failed");
                return OrderResult.failed(order);
            }
        } catch (InventoryException e) {
            // Compensate Step 1
            order.markFailed("Out of stock");
            return OrderResult.failed(order);
        }
    }

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What are the failure modes of the Saga pattern?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests deep understanding of distributed transaction challenges.

**Answer:**

1. **Compensation failure:** What if the compensating action itself fails? (Payment charged, shipping fails, inventory release fails.) Solution: retry compensations with exponential backoff. Store compensation state. Use a dead letter queue for failed compensations.

2. **Intermediate states:** Between steps, data is temporarily inconsistent. (Order created, inventory not yet reserved.) Users might see stale data. Solution: use saga status fields ("PENDING," "PROCESSING," "COMPLETED") and design UI for intermediate states.

3. **Idempotency:** If a step is retried, it must be idempotent. Charging payment twice is catastrophic. Solution: idempotency keys on every step.

4. **Ordering:** In choreography, events might arrive out of order. Solution: include saga ID and step number in events. Consumers validate ordering.

# Outbox Pattern

**TL;DR** - Outbox Pattern ensures reliable event publishing by writing events to a database table (outbox) in the same transaction as the business operation, then asynchronously polling and publishing them to the broker.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**THE DUAL-WRITE PROBLEM:**

```
@Transactional
public void createOrder(Order order) {
    orderRepo.save(order);        // DB write
    kafka.send("order-events",    // Broker write
        new OrderCreatedEvent(order));
}
```

What if the DB write succeeds but the Kafka send fails? The order exists but no event is published. What if Kafka succeeds but the transaction rolls back? An event is published for a non-existent order. You can't atomically write to a database AND a message broker.

**TL;DR** - Backpressure is a mechanism where a consumer signals to the producer to slow down when it can't keep up with the incoming data rate, preventing system overload.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Producer generates 10,000 events/sec. Consumer processes 5,000/sec. Without backpressure: memory fills with buffered events, GC thrashes, OOM crash. The fast producer kills the slow consumer.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
WITHOUT BACKPRESSURE:
[Producer 10K/s] =====> [Buffer FULL] X [Consumer 5K/s]
                            OOM crash

WITH BACKPRESSURE:
[Producer] <-- "slow down" -- [Consumer]
[Producer 5K/s] ====> [Buffer OK] ===> [Consumer 5K/s]
                        balanced
```

**Strategies:**

1. **Drop:** Discard newest/oldest messages when buffer is full (acceptable for metrics)
2. **Buffer:** Expand buffer dynamically (defers the problem)
3. **Block:** Producer blocks until consumer catches up (simplest, but blocks upstream)
4. **Rate limit:** Producer sends at consumer's declared rate
5. **Reactive pull:** Consumer requests N items when ready (Reactive Streams)

# CQRS with Events

**TL;DR** - CQRS separates read and write models, using events to keep the read model synchronized with the write model, enabling independent optimization of each.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your e-commerce system has a normalized write model (orders, line_items, products - 3 tables with JOINs). Reads need a denormalized view (order with full product details, customer info, shipping status). The same model can't be optimal for both: normalized for writes (avoid anomalies) and denormalized for reads (avoid JOINs).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
WRITE SIDE:
[Command] -> [Command Handler] -> [Write DB]
                    |
             [Publish Event]
                    |
READ SIDE:          v
[Event] -> [Event Handler] -> [Read DB/Cache]
                                    |
[Query] -> [Query Handler] --------+
```

**Key principles:**

1. Write model: normalized, optimized for consistency and validation
2. Read model: denormalized, optimized for query patterns
3. Events synchronize write -> read (eventually consistent)
4. Commands change state. Queries return state. Never mix.

# Priority Queues

**TL;DR** - Priority queues process messages based on priority level rather than arrival order, ensuring critical tasks are handled before routine ones.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your support ticket system processes tickets first-come-first-served. A critical production outage ticket waits behind 500 password reset tickets. The outage takes 3 hours to reach a human because the queue doesn't distinguish urgency.
---

### Implementation Approaches

```
APPROACH 1: Multiple queues (recommended)
[High Priority Queue]   -> [Workers] (dedicated)
[Medium Priority Queue]  -> [Workers] (shared)
[Low Priority Queue]     -> [Workers] (shared)

APPROACH 2: Broker-level priority (RabbitMQ)
[Single Queue with priority 0-9]
  -> Broker delivers highest priority first
  -> Only RabbitMQ supports this natively

APPROACH 3: Weighted consumption
  Read 5 from high, 3 from medium, 1 from low
  per polling cycle
```

# Async API Design

**TL;DR** - Async APIs accept requests immediately, process them in the background, and provide status endpoints or callbacks for clients to get results.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your API generates a financial report that takes 45 seconds. The HTTP connection times out at 30 seconds. The client gets an error even though the report was being generated. You can't make a 45-second operation synchronous.

### Design Decisions

| Pattern   | Use when                          | Client complexity |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Polling   | Simple clients, web browsers      | Low               |
| Webhooks  | Server-to-server, real-time needs | Medium            |
| WebSocket | Real-time progress updates        | Higher            |
| SSE       | One-way server push, progress     | Medium            |

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Return 202 Accepted with a job ID for async operations
2. Provide a status endpoint (GET /jobs/{id}) with `Retry-After` header
3. Support both polling and webhooks for different client needs

**Interview one-liner:**
"For operations exceeding request timeout, I return 202 Accepted with a job ID, process in the background, and provide both polling endpoints and webhook callbacks - the Location header points to the status URL."
