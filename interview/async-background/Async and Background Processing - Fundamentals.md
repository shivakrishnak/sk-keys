# Sync vs Async vs Parallel

**TL;DR** - Synchronous blocks the caller until completion, asynchronous returns immediately with a future result, and parallel executes multiple tasks simultaneously on different threads/cores.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT ASYNC:**
Your API endpoint processes a user order: validate (5ms), charge payment (500ms), send email (300ms), update analytics (200ms). Synchronously, the user waits 1005ms. With 100 concurrent users, you need 100 threads blocked on payment/email calls. Thread pool exhaustion at 200 concurrent requests.

**THE BREAKING POINT:**
Payment gateway takes 2 seconds on a bad day. 200 threads blocked. Thread pool is full. New requests are rejected. Users see 503 errors. The system is doing nothing - just waiting.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"Only validation and payment are required to respond. Email and analytics can happen later."

**EVOLUTION:**
From blocking I/O (early servers) to thread pools (Tomcat) to non-blocking I/O (Netty, Node.js) to reactive streams (Spring WebFlux, Project Reactor) to virtual threads (Java 21 Loom). Each step increased throughput by reducing thread blocking.

---

### Textbook Definition

**Synchronous:** The caller waits for the operation to complete before continuing. Thread is blocked. **Asynchronous:** The caller initiates the operation and continues immediately. Result arrives later via callback, future, or event. **Parallel:** Multiple operations execute simultaneously on different CPU cores. Parallel is about execution. Async is about waiting.

---

### Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Sync waits, async delegates, parallel multiplies.

**One analogy:**

> Ordering at a restaurant. **Sync:** You order, stand at the counter, stare at the chef until food is ready. **Async:** You order, get a buzzer, sit down and read. The buzzer alerts you when ready. **Parallel:** Three chefs make three dishes simultaneously.

**One insight:**
Async and parallel are orthogonal. You can have async without parallel (one thread handling multiple I/O operations via event loop) and parallel without async (multiple threads each blocking on their own I/O). Node.js is async single-threaded. Java's `parallelStream()` is parallel synchronous.

---

### First Principles Explanation

**CORE INVARIANTS:**

1. Sync: caller thread is blocked until result is available
2. Async: caller thread is free while operation proceeds elsewhere
3. Parallel: multiple operations physically execute at the same time

**THE TRADE-OFFS:**
**Sync:** Simple code, easy debugging, but wastes threads on I/O waits
**Async:** Efficient thread usage, but complex error handling and callback chains
**Parallel:** Maximum throughput for CPU-bound work, but synchronization complexity

---

### How It Works

```
SYNCHRONOUS:
Thread: [call]---[wait...]---[result]---[continue]

ASYNCHRONOUS:
Thread: [call]---[continue other work]
                         ...
        [callback/future completes later]

PARALLEL:
Core 1: [task A]---->[done]
Core 2: [task B]---->[done]
Core 3: [task C]---->[done]
         (all execute simultaneously)
```

---

### Code Example

**Sync (blocking):**

```java
// Thread blocked for 800ms total
public OrderResult processSync(Order order) {
    validate(order);             // 5ms
    PaymentResult pay = charge(order); // 500ms WAIT
    sendEmail(order);            // 300ms WAIT
    return OrderResult.ok(pay);
}
```

**Async (non-blocking):**

```java
// Thread freed during I/O waits
public CompletableFuture<OrderResult> processAsync(
        Order order) {
    validate(order);
    return chargeAsync(order)
        .thenApply(pay -> {
            sendEmailAsync(order); // Fire and forget
            return OrderResult.ok(pay);
        });
}
```

**Parallel:**

```java
// CPU-bound work split across cores
public BigDecimal totalRevenue(List<Order> orders) {
    return orders.parallelStream()
        .map(Order::getTotal)
        .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
}
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Sync blocks the thread; async frees it; parallel uses multiple threads
2. Use async for I/O-bound work (network, disk); parallel for CPU-bound work
3. Node.js proves you can be async without parallelism (single-threaded event loop)

**Interview one-liner:**
"Sync blocks the caller, async returns immediately with a future result and frees the thread for other work, and parallel executes tasks simultaneously on multiple cores - I choose based on whether the bottleneck is I/O-bound (async) or CPU-bound (parallel)."

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: When would you choose sync over async in a modern system?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests judgment about trade-offs rather than defaulting to "async everything."

**Answer:**
Sync is better when:

1. **Low-latency, in-process operations:** Cache lookups, in-memory calculations, local file reads. Async overhead (future creation, context switching) exceeds the operation time.

2. **Sequential dependencies:** When step B needs step A's result and step C needs step B's. Forced sequential async just adds complexity over sync.

3. **Debugging priority:** Async stack traces are broken across callbacks. For critical business logic that must be debuggable, sync is clearer.

4. **Java 21+ virtual threads:** Virtual threads give you async-like scalability with sync-like code. `Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> blockingCall())` handles millions of concurrent blocking calls without async complexity.

---

**Q2: How does Java 21's virtual threads change the async vs sync decision?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests knowledge of modern Java concurrency evolution.

**Answer:**
Virtual threads make sync code scalable:

| Aspect         | Platform threads | Virtual threads       |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Cost           | ~1MB stack each  | ~1KB stack each       |
| Max concurrent | ~5,000           | ~1,000,000+           |
| Blocking       | Wastes OS thread | Unmounts from carrier |
| Code style     | Async/reactive   | Simple blocking       |
| Debugging      | Broken traces    | Normal stack traces   |

With virtual threads, you write blocking code (`result = httpClient.send(request)`) and the JVM handles the non-blocking mechanics. You get async throughput with sync readability. This makes reactive frameworks (WebFlux) less necessary for I/O-bound workloads, though reactive still offers backpressure and stream processing benefits.

# Message Queue vs Event Bus

**TL;DR** - A message queue delivers messages to a single consumer (point-to-point), while an event bus broadcasts events to all interested subscribers (publish-subscribe).

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT EITHER:**
Service A needs to tell Service B about a new order. Direct HTTP call: if B is down, the order is lost. If B is slow, A is slow. If C also needs to know, A must call C too. Every new consumer requires modifying A. Tight coupling, no resilience.

**THE KEY DISTINCTION:**
Sometimes exactly ONE consumer should process a message (job processing - "resize this image"). Other times MANY consumers should react to the same event ("order placed" triggers shipping, billing, analytics). These are fundamentally different communication patterns.

---

### Textbook Definition

A **message queue** provides point-to-point communication where a message is delivered to exactly one consumer from a pool. Consumers compete for messages. A **event bus** (pub/sub) provides one-to-many communication where an event is delivered to all subscribers of that topic. Each subscriber gets a copy.

---

### How It Works

```
MESSAGE QUEUE (point-to-point):
[Producer] -> [Queue] -> [Consumer A]  (picks 1)
                     |-> [Consumer B]  (gets next)
                     |-> [Consumer C]  (gets next)
  One message = one consumer processes it

EVENT BUS (pub/sub):
[Publisher] -> [Topic] -> [Subscriber A] (gets copy)
                      |-> [Subscriber B] (gets copy)
                      |-> [Subscriber C] (gets copy)
  One event = all subscribers receive it
```

---

### Comparison

| Aspect           | Message Queue          | Event Bus (Pub/Sub)           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Delivery         | One consumer per msg   | All subscribers               |
| Use case         | Work distribution      | Event notification            |
| Example          | Job queue, task queue  | Domain events                 |
| Coupling         | Producer knows queue   | Producer knows topic          |
| Consumer failure | Message stays in queue | Missed unless persisted       |
| Technology       | SQS, RabbitMQ queue    | Kafka topic, SNS, EventBridge |

---

### Code Example

```java
// Message Queue: work distribution
// Only ONE worker processes each image
@RabbitListener(queues = "image-resize")
public void processImage(ResizeTask task) {
    imageService.resize(task.imageId(), task.size());
}

// Event Bus: notification broadcast
// ALL listeners receive every order event
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events",
    groupId = "shipping-service")
public void onOrderCreated(OrderEvent event) {
    shippingService.prepareShipment(event);
}

@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events",
    groupId = "billing-service")
public void onOrderCreated(OrderEvent event) {
    billingService.generateInvoice(event);
}
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Queue = one consumer gets the message (work distribution)
2. Event bus = all subscribers get the event (notification broadcast)
3. Kafka supports both: same consumer group = queue, different groups = pub/sub

**Interview one-liner:**
"Message queues deliver to one consumer for work distribution; event buses broadcast to all subscribers for notification - Kafka supports both via consumer groups."

---

---

# At-Least-Once vs Exactly-Once Delivery

**TL;DR** - At-least-once guarantees no message is lost but may deliver duplicates; exactly-once guarantees each message is processed exactly one time but is expensive and often impossible in distributed systems.

---

### The Problem This Solves

A payment processing system sends a "charge customer $100" message. What happens if the network fails after the consumer processes the message but before it acknowledges it?

- **At-most-once:** Message is never retried. Payment might be lost. Unacceptable.
- **At-least-once:** Message is retried. Customer might be charged twice. Fixable with idempotency.
- **Exactly-once:** Message is processed exactly once. Ideal but extremely hard in distributed systems.

---

### How It Works

```
AT-LEAST-ONCE:
[Producer] -> [Broker] -> [Consumer]
                              |
                     processes message
                              |
                     ACK fails (network)
                              |
                     [Broker retries delivery]
                              |
                     Consumer processes AGAIN
                     (duplicate!)

EXACTLY-ONCE (Kafka):
[Producer] -> [Broker] -> [Consumer]
                              |
                     processes + commits offset
                     in SAME transaction
                              |
                     No duplicates possible
                     (but only within Kafka)
```

---

### Comparison

| Guarantee     | Message loss? | Duplicates? | Cost    | Use case                   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| At-most-once  | Possible      | Never       | Lowest  | Metrics, logs              |
| At-least-once | Never         | Possible    | Medium  | Most systems + idempotency |
| Exactly-once  | Never         | Never       | Highest | Financial transactions     |

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. At-least-once + idempotency is the practical standard for most systems
2. True exactly-once across systems is impossible (Two Generals Problem)
3. Kafka's "exactly-once" works within Kafka (transactions) but not across external systems

**Interview one-liner:**
"At-least-once delivery with idempotent consumers is the practical standard - I make consumers safe for duplicate processing by using idempotency keys or database upserts rather than chasing impossible exactly-once guarantees across system boundaries."

---

---

# Idempotency

**TL;DR** - An idempotent operation produces the same result whether executed once or multiple times, making it safe to retry without side effects.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IDEMPOTENCY:**
Payment message is delivered twice (network retry). Customer is charged $100 twice. Total: $200 instead of $100. Without idempotency, every retry is dangerous.

**THE CRITICAL INSIGHT:**
In distributed systems, messages WILL be duplicated. Networks fail after processing but before acknowledgment. The question isn't "how to prevent duplicates" but "how to make duplicates harmless."

---

### How It Works

```
NON-IDEMPOTENT (dangerous):
Request 1: balance = balance + 100  -> $100
Request 2: balance = balance + 100  -> $200 !!

IDEMPOTENT (safe):
Request 1: SET balance = 100        -> $100
Request 2: SET balance = 100        -> $100 (same!)

WITH IDEMPOTENCY KEY:
Request 1 (key=abc): charge $100    -> processed
Request 2 (key=abc): charge $100    -> already done,
                                       return cached
```

---

### Code Example

**BAD: Non-idempotent**

```java
// BAD: Retry = double charge
public void processPayment(PaymentRequest req) {
    account.debit(req.getAmount()); // Additive!
}
```

**GOOD: Idempotent with key**

```java
// GOOD: Retry is harmless
public void processPayment(PaymentRequest req) {
    String key = req.getIdempotencyKey();
    if (processedKeys.contains(key)) {
        return; // Already processed
    }
    account.debit(req.getAmount());
    processedKeys.add(key);
}

// Even better: database upsert
public void processPayment(PaymentRequest req) {
    // INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
    paymentRepo.upsert(Payment.from(req));
}
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Idempotent = safe to execute multiple times with same result
2. Implement with: idempotency keys, database upserts, or conditional writes
3. HTTP: GET, PUT, DELETE are idempotent; POST is not (by convention)

**Interview one-liner:**
"Idempotency makes operations safe to retry by producing the same result regardless of execution count - I implement it with idempotency keys stored in the database, making at-least-once delivery safe for any consumer."

---

### Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How would you implement idempotency for a payment processing API?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical ability to handle distributed system challenges.

**Answer:**

```java
@PostMapping("/payments")
public ResponseEntity<PaymentResult> createPayment(
        @RequestHeader("Idempotency-Key") String key,
        @RequestBody PaymentRequest req) {

    // Check if already processed
    Optional<Payment> existing =
        paymentRepo.findByIdempotencyKey(key);
    if (existing.isPresent()) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(
            existing.get().toResult()); // Cached
    }

    // Process payment
    Payment payment = paymentService.process(req);
    payment.setIdempotencyKey(key);
    paymentRepo.save(payment);

    return ResponseEntity.status(201)
        .body(payment.toResult());
}
```

Key design decisions:

1. **Client generates the key:** Usually a UUID. Client retries with the same key.
2. **Store key in database:** With a unique constraint. Race conditions are handled by the DB.
3. **Return cached result:** Don't just return 200 OK. Return the same response body so the client can process it.
4. **TTL for keys:** Expire after 24-48 hours to prevent unbounded growth.

---

# Job Queues

**TL;DR** - Job queues decouple task submission from execution, allowing background processing of time-consuming work without blocking the user-facing request.

---

### The Problem This Solves

User uploads a 100MB video. Processing takes 5 minutes (transcode, generate thumbnails, analyze content). Without a job queue, the HTTP request blocks for 5 minutes. The user sees a spinning loader. If they close the browser, the processing is lost.

With a job queue: submit a "process video" job, return immediately with a job ID. The user can check progress asynchronously. The worker processes the video in the background.

---

### How It Works

```
[User Request] -> [API Server]
                      |
                 Submit job to queue
                      |
                 Return job ID (202 Accepted)
                      |
[User polls status]   [Worker picks up job]
                      |
                 [Process video]
                      |
                 [Update job status: complete]
```

---

### Code Example

```java
// Submit job (returns immediately)
@PostMapping("/videos")
public ResponseEntity<JobResponse> uploadVideo(
        @RequestBody VideoUpload upload) {
    String jobId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    jobQueue.submit(new VideoProcessingJob(
        jobId, upload));
    return ResponseEntity.accepted()
        .body(new JobResponse(jobId, "QUEUED"));
}

// Worker processes jobs
@Component
public class VideoWorker {
    @RabbitListener(queues = "video-processing")
    public void process(VideoProcessingJob job) {
        jobStatusRepo.update(job.id(), "PROCESSING");
        try {
            videoService.transcode(job);
            videoService.generateThumbnails(job);
            jobStatusRepo.update(job.id(), "COMPLETE");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            jobStatusRepo.update(job.id(), "FAILED");
        }
    }
}

// Check status
@GetMapping("/jobs/{id}")
public JobStatus getStatus(@PathVariable String id) {
    return jobStatusRepo.findById(id);
}
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Job queues decouple submission (fast) from processing (slow)
2. Return 202 Accepted with a job ID for async operations
3. Provide a status endpoint so clients can poll or use webhooks for completion

**Interview one-liner:**
"Job queues decouple task submission from execution - I return 202 Accepted with a job ID immediately, process the work in background workers, and provide a status endpoint for clients to track progress."

---

---

# Delivery Guarantees

**TL;DR** - Delivery guarantees define how many times a message will be delivered: at-most-once (may lose), at-least-once (may duplicate), or exactly-once (neither, but expensive).

---

### The Problem This Solves

In distributed messaging, three failures can occur: (1) message never reaches the broker, (2) broker crashes before delivering, (3) consumer crashes after processing but before acknowledging. Each delivery guarantee addresses these failures differently with different trade-offs.

---

### How Each Works

```
AT-MOST-ONCE:
[Producer] -> [Broker] -> [Consumer]
  "Fire and forget"
  - Fast, no retries
  - Message may be lost
  - Use for: metrics, logs, non-critical events

AT-LEAST-ONCE:
[Producer] -> [Broker] -> [Consumer]
  "Retry until ACK"         |
                    [No ACK? Redeliver]
  - No message loss
  - May deliver duplicates
  - Use for: most systems + idempotent consumers

EXACTLY-ONCE:
[Producer] -> [Broker] -> [Consumer]
  "Transactional delivery"
  - No loss, no duplicates
  - Requires transactions + dedup
  - Use for: financial, billing
```

---

### Comparison by Broker

| Broker        | At-most-once | At-least-once | Exactly-once         |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Kafka         | Yes          | Default       | Yes (within Kafka)   |
| RabbitMQ      | Yes          | Default       | No (use idempotency) |
| SQS           | Yes          | Default       | FIFO queues only     |
| Redis Pub/Sub | Default      | No            | No                   |

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. At-least-once + idempotent consumers is the industry standard
2. Exactly-once across system boundaries requires distributed transactions (expensive)
3. Choose based on: can you afford message loss? Can you handle duplicates?

**Interview one-liner:**
"I default to at-least-once delivery with idempotent consumers because it's the practical sweet spot - no message loss, and duplicates are harmless thanks to idempotency keys or database upserts."

---

# Async Mental Model

**TL;DR** - Think of async as a restaurant: the waiter (thread) takes orders and delivers food but never cooks. The kitchen (worker pool) cooks asynchronously. The waiter serves many tables because they never block waiting for a dish.

---

### The Problem This Solves

Developers struggle with async because they think in sequential steps: "do A, then B, then C." Async requires a different mental model: "initiate A, do other work, react when A completes."

---

### The Mental Model

```
SYNC MENTAL MODEL (step-by-step):
[Do A] -> [Wait] -> [Do B] -> [Wait] -> [Do C]
Thread is occupied the entire time

ASYNC MENTAL MODEL (initiate-and-react):
[Initiate A] -> [Free to do other work]
                  ...
[A completes] -> [React to A's result]
[Initiate B] -> [Free to do other work]
                  ...
[B completes] -> [React to B's result]
```

**Key principles:**

1. **Threads are waiters, not chefs.** A thread should take orders (accept requests) and deliver results (send responses). It should never cook (do slow I/O and wait).

2. **Callbacks are buzzers.** When you place an order at a fast-food restaurant, you get a buzzer. You don't stand at the counter waiting. The buzzer (callback/future) notifies you when the work is done.

3. **Event loops are single-waiter restaurants.** Node.js has one waiter serving hundreds of tables. It works because the waiter never cooks - they just deliver orders to the kitchen and pick up completed dishes.

4. **Thread pools are kitchen staff.** The pool size determines how many dishes can be cooked simultaneously. Too few workers = orders pile up. Too many = workers trip over each other.

5. **Backpressure is a full kitchen.** When the kitchen can't keep up, the waiter must slow down accepting orders. This is backpressure: the consumer signals the producer to slow down.

---

### How to Apply This

| Situation                     | Sync/Async?           | Why                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Database query (5ms)          | Sync                  | Fast enough, don't add async overhead |
| External API call (500ms)     | Async                 | Don't block thread for 500ms          |
| Send email (300ms)            | Async (fire & forget) | User doesn't need to wait             |
| File upload processing (5min) | Job queue             | Way too long for any request thread   |
| In-memory calculation         | Sync                  | No I/O wait, async adds overhead      |
| Batch data processing         | Parallel              | CPU-bound, use multiple cores         |

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Threads are waiters (coordinate), not chefs (do heavy work)
2. Make I/O async, keep computation sync, and use job queues for long tasks
3. Backpressure = telling the producer to slow down when the consumer can't keep up

**Interview one-liner:**
"I think of async as a restaurant: threads are waiters who should never block waiting for the kitchen. I make I/O operations async, keep CPU-bound work parallel, and use job queues for anything that takes longer than a request timeout."
