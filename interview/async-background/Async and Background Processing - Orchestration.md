# Temporal

**TL;DR** - Temporal is a workflow orchestration platform that makes complex, long-running, distributed workflows durable and fault-tolerant by automatically handling retries, timeouts, and state persistence.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your order fulfillment workflow spans 5 services and takes 3 days. If any service crashes, the entire workflow state is lost. You've built retry logic, state tracking, timeout handling, and failure compensation manually. The infrastructure code is 10x larger than the business logic.

**Temporal's insight:** What if the platform handled all the durability, retries, and state persistence? You'd write only the business logic, and the workflow would survive crashes, restarts, and deployments automatically.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
[Temporal Server] (manages state + history)
       |
[Workflow Worker] (executes workflow code)
       |
  Workflow: OrderFulfillment
    Step 1: Create order (Activity)
    Step 2: Reserve inventory (Activity)
    Step 3: Wait for payment (Timer: 24h)
    Step 4: Charge payment (Activity)
    Step 5: Ship order (Activity)
       |
  If worker crashes at Step 3:
    -> Temporal replays history
    -> Workflow resumes at Step 3
    -> No data loss, no duplicate work
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Workflow:** Durable function that orchestrates activities. Survives crashes via event sourcing.
- **Activity:** Side-effect operation (API call, DB write). Retried automatically on failure.
- **Worker:** Process that executes workflows and activities. Stateless - can be scaled horizontally.
- **Task Queue:** Workflow/activity tasks are dispatched through queues to workers.

### 💻 Code Example

```java
// Workflow interface
@WorkflowInterface
public interface OrderWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    OrderResult processOrder(OrderRequest request);
}

// Workflow implementation (durable logic)
public class OrderWorkflowImpl
        implements OrderWorkflow {
    private final OrderActivities activities =
        Workflow.newActivityStub(
            OrderActivities.class,
            ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                .setStartToCloseTimeout(
                    Duration.ofMinutes(5))
                .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions
                    .newBuilder()
                    .setMaximumAttempts(3)
                    .build())
                .build());

    @Override
    public OrderResult processOrder(
            OrderRequest request) {
        // Each step is durable - survives crashes
        Order order = activities.createOrder(request);
        activities.reserveInventory(order);

        // Wait up to 24h for payment confirmation
        Workflow.sleep(Duration.ofHours(24));

        activities.chargePayment(order);
        activities.shipOrder(order);
        return OrderResult.success(order);
    }
}

// Activity interface (side effects)
@ActivityInterface
public interface OrderActivities {
    Order createOrder(OrderRequest request);
    void reserveInventory(Order order);
    void chargePayment(Order order);
    void shipOrder(Order order);

### When to Use Temporal

| Use case                    | Temporal fit |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Multi-step, long-running    | Excellent    |
| Cross-service orchestration | Excellent    |
| Human-in-the-loop workflows | Good         |
| Simple task queue           | Overkill     |
| Sub-millisecond latency     | Not suitable |

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Temporal makes workflows durable by replaying event history on crash recovery
2. Write business logic as normal code; Temporal handles retries, timeouts, and state
3. Best for long-running, multi-service workflows (order processing, onboarding)

**Interview one-liner:**
"Temporal makes distributed workflows durable by persisting event history and replaying on recovery - I write business logic as normal code and let Temporal handle retries, timeouts, and crash recovery automatically."

# AWS Step Functions

**TL;DR** - Step Functions is AWS's serverless workflow orchestrator that coordinates Lambda functions and AWS services using a visual state machine defined in JSON/YAML.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

You need to orchestrate 5 Lambda functions with branching, parallel execution, retries, and error handling. Without Step Functions, you chain Lambdas through SQS queues and DynamoDB state tracking. The orchestration logic is spread across 5 Lambda functions.

# Cron Jobs and Scheduling

**TL;DR** - Cron jobs execute tasks at fixed time intervals, essential for batch processing, report generation, cleanup, and any recurring background work.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your system needs to: generate daily reports at 6 AM, clean up expired sessions every hour, retry failed payments every 15 minutes, and archive old data monthly. These are recurring tasks that shouldn't be triggered by user requests.

### 💻 Code Example

```java

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 900_000)
    public void retryFailedPayments() {

### Pitfalls

1. **Single instance problem:** In a clustered deployment, the same cron job runs on every instance. Solution: distributed lock (ShedLock) or designated leader.
2. **Long-running overlap:** If a job takes 20 minutes and runs every 15 minutes, they overlap. Use `fixedDelay` instead of `fixedRate`, or add `@SchedulerLock`.
3. **No retry:** Spring `@Scheduled` has no built-in retry. Wrap with try-catch and manual retry logic.
4. **Timezone:** Always specify timezone in cron expressions for production.

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. `@Scheduled` with `fixedRate` for periodic tasks, `cron` for time-based schedules
2. In clusters, use ShedLock or distributed locking to prevent duplicate execution
3. `fixedDelay` waits after completion; `fixedRate` runs at fixed intervals regardless

**Interview one-liner:**
"I use Spring's @Scheduled for recurring tasks with ShedLock for distributed locking in clusters - fixedRate for periodic work and cron expressions for time-based schedules, always guarding against overlap and multi-instance duplication."

# Distributed Scheduler

**TL;DR** - A distributed scheduler ensures scheduled tasks run exactly once across a cluster by coordinating through shared state, preventing duplicate execution in multi-instance deployments.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

You deploy 4 instances of your application. Each has `@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 6 * * *")` for daily report generation. At 6 AM, all 4 instances generate the report. Four identical emails go to the CEO. Embarrassing.

---

### Solutions

```
APPROACH 1: Distributed Lock (ShedLock)
Instance A: acquires lock -> runs job
Instance B: lock taken -> skips
Instance C: lock taken -> skips
Instance D: lock taken -> skips

APPROACH 2: Leader Election
[Cluster]
  Instance A: LEADER -> runs scheduled jobs
  Instance B: FOLLOWER -> standby
  Instance C: FOLLOWER -> standby
  (Leader dies -> election -> new leader)

APPROACH 3: External Scheduler
[Kubernetes CronJob] -> [Single Pod] -> runs job
[AWS EventBridge]    -> [Single Lambda] -> runs job
```

# Workflow Orchestration

**TL;DR** - Workflow orchestration coordinates complex multi-step processes across services with state management, error handling, retries, and human approval steps.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Employee onboarding involves: create AD account, provision email, assign laptop, set up VPN, assign training, notify manager, wait for manager approval, provision building access. This spans 8 systems, takes 3 days, requires human interaction, and must handle failures at any step.

---

### Orchestration vs Choreography

```
ORCHESTRATION (central conductor):
[Orchestrator]
  -> Step 1: Create account
  -> Step 2: Provision email
  -> Step 3: Wait for manager approval
  -> Step 4: Assign laptop
  Orchestrator knows the full flow

CHOREOGRAPHY (dance without conductor):
[Create Account] -> event -> [Provision Email]
                           -> event -> [Assign Laptop]
Each service reacts independently
No single service knows the full flow
```

| Aspect         | Orchestration                   | Choreography                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Visibility     | Full flow in one place          | Distributed, harder to trace |
| Coupling       | Orchestrator knows all services | Services independent         |
| Error handling | Centralized                     | Each service handles own     |
| Complexity     | Better for 5+ steps             | Better for 2-3 steps         |
| Single failure | Orchestrator is SPOF            | No single point              |

# Celery

**TL;DR** - Celery is a Python distributed task queue that handles async task execution, scheduling, and retries - the de facto standard for background processing in Python/Django applications.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your Django application needs to send emails, generate PDFs, and process images without blocking HTTP requests. Python's GIL limits true parallelism. Celery distributes tasks to worker processes, providing async execution with a simple decorator API.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
[Quartz Scheduler]
    |
  [Job Store] (RAM or JDBC)
    |
  [Triggers]
    |-- CronTrigger: "0 0 6 * * ?"
    |-- SimpleTrigger: every 30 seconds
    |-- CalendarIntervalTrigger: every 3rd business day
    |
  [Jobs]
    |-- DailyReportJob
    |-- CleanupJob
    |-- PaymentRetryJob
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Job:** What to execute (implements `Job` interface)
- **Trigger:** When to execute (cron, simple interval, calendar)
- **Scheduler:** Manages jobs and triggers
- **JobStore:** RAM (volatile) or JDBC (persistent, clustered)

### Quartz vs Spring @Scheduled

| Feature            | Quartz        | @Scheduled        |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Persistence        | JDBC JobStore | None              |
| Clustering         | Built-in      | Needs ShedLock    |
| Dynamic scheduling | Runtime API   | Compile-time only |
| Misfire handling   | Configurable  | None              |
| Calendar triggers  | Yes           | No                |
| Complexity         | Higher        | Minimal           |

**PROBLEM IT SOLVES:** [TODO]
**KEY INSIGHT:** [TODO]
**USE WHEN:** [TODO]
**AVOID WHEN:** [TODO]
**ANTI-PATTERN:** [TODO]

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Quartz provides persistent, clustered job scheduling with rich trigger options
2. Use JDBC JobStore for persistence and clustering in production
3. Spring @Scheduled is simpler for basic needs; Quartz for advanced scheduling

**Interview one-liner:**
"Quartz is my choice when I need persistent, clustered job scheduling with dynamic runtime configuration and misfire handling - for simple fixed-schedule tasks, Spring's @Scheduled with ShedLock is sufficient."
