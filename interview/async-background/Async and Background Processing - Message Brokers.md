# RabbitMQ

**TL;DR** - RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker implementing AMQP with smart routing, exchanges, and bindings - ideal for complex routing, RPC patterns, and task distribution.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your microservices need reliable message delivery with complex routing: order events go to shipping AND billing, but priority orders go to a special handler, and returns go to a different queue entirely. You need a broker that understands routing logic, not just pass-through delivery.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
[Producer] -> [Exchange] -> [Binding] -> [Queue] -> [Consumer]

Exchange types:
  Direct:  route by exact routing key
  Topic:   route by pattern (order.*)
  Fanout:  broadcast to all bound queues
  Headers: route by message headers
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Exchange:** Receives messages, routes to queues based on type and binding rules
- **Queue:** Stores messages until consumed. Messages are removed after ACK
- **Binding:** Rules connecting exchanges to queues
- **Consumer ACK:** Consumer confirms processing. No ACK = message redelivered

### When to Use RabbitMQ

| Strength            | Detail                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Complex routing     | Topic, header, and fanout exchanges       |
| Request-reply (RPC) | Built-in reply queues and correlation IDs |
| Priority queues     | Native message priority support           |
| Message TTL         | Per-message and per-queue expiration      |
| Lightweight         | Low operational overhead vs Kafka         |
| Protocol support    | AMQP, MQTT, STOMP                         |

**Avoid when:** You need log-style replay, very high throughput (100K+ msg/sec), or long-term message retention.

# Apache Kafka

**TL;DR** - Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that stores events as an immutable, ordered, replayable log - ideal for high-throughput event streaming, event sourcing, and data pipelines.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Your system produces 500K events per second. Multiple services need different views of the same data. Some consumers process in real-time, others batch-process hourly. Traditional message brokers delete messages after consumption, so you can't replay or reprocess. You need a persistent, ordered, replayable event log.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
[Producers] -> [Topic]
                |
        [Partition 0] [Partition 1] [Partition 2]
        offset: 0,1,2  offset: 0,1   offset: 0,1,2,3
                |            |            |
        [Consumer Group A - real-time processing]
        [Consumer Group B - batch analytics]
        [Consumer Group C - search indexing]

Each group reads ALL partitions independently.
Each partition within a group is read by ONE consumer.
Messages are NOT deleted after consumption.
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Topic:** Named stream of events (like a table)
- **Partition:** Ordered, immutable sequence of events within a topic. Parallelism unit
- **Offset:** Position of a message in a partition. Consumers track their own offset
- **Consumer Group:** Set of consumers that cooperatively read a topic. Each partition is assigned to one consumer in the group
- **Retention:** Messages are kept for a configurable period (default 7 days), not deleted on consumption

### Kafka vs RabbitMQ

| Aspect         | Kafka                         | RabbitMQ               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Model          | Distributed log               | Message broker         |
| Retention      | Configurable (days/forever)   | Until consumed         |
| Replay         | Yes (reset consumer offset)   | No (consumed = gone)   |
| Throughput     | 1M+ msg/sec per cluster       | ~50K msg/sec per node  |
| Ordering       | Per partition                 | Per queue              |
| Routing        | Topic + partition key only    | Exchanges + bindings   |
| Consumer model | Pull (consumer controls pace) | Push (broker delivers) |
| Use case       | Event streaming, log          | Task queue, RPC        |

 Specific. Makes this concept permanently memorable.]

---

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you choose between Kafka and RabbitMQ?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical architecture decision-making.

**Answer:**
Decision framework:

**Choose Kafka when:**

- High throughput (>50K msg/sec)
- Multiple consumers need the same events
- You need event replay (reprocessing, debugging)
- Event sourcing / CQRS architecture
- Data pipeline / stream processing (Kafka Streams, Flink)
- Log aggregation at scale

**Choose RabbitMQ when:**

- Complex routing logic (topic/header-based routing)
- Request-reply (RPC) patterns
- Message priority is needed
- Lower throughput with smart routing
- Simpler operations and smaller team
- Protocol diversity (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP)

**In practice:** Many systems use both. Kafka for the event backbone (high-throughput streaming). RabbitMQ for internal task distribution (job queues, notifications).

# Amazon SQS

**TL;DR** - SQS is a fully managed message queue service from AWS requiring zero operational overhead - ideal for simple, reliable task distribution in AWS environments.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

You need a message queue but don't want to manage RabbitMQ clusters, handle broker failover, or worry about disk space. You need a queue that just works with no infrastructure management.

# Kafka Consumer Groups

**TL;DR** - Consumer groups enable parallel processing of a Kafka topic by assigning each partition to exactly one consumer within the group, while different groups process the same data independently.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

A Kafka topic has 1 million events per hour. One consumer can process 200K/hour. You need 5 consumers to keep up. But each event should be processed only once per service. Consumer groups solve this: within a group, partitions are divided among consumers. Across groups, each group gets all events independently.

  Consumer E: partitions 3, 4, 5
  -> Same events processed independently

REBALANCE (Consumer B dies):
  Consumer A: partitions 0, 1, 2, 3
  Consumer C: partitions 4, 5
  -> Automatic partition reassignment
```

**Rules:**

1. Each partition -> at most one consumer per group
2. One consumer can handle multiple partitions
3. More consumers than partitions = some consumers idle
4. Consumer death triggers automatic rebalance

# Kafka Exactly-Once Semantics

**TL;DR** - Kafka's exactly-once semantics (EOS) ensures each record is processed exactly once within Kafka using idempotent producers and transactional consumers, but does NOT extend to external systems.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

A Kafka consumer reads an event, processes it, and writes the result to another Kafka topic. If the consumer crashes after writing but before committing the offset, it reprocesses the event and writes a duplicate to the output topic. Kafka's EOS prevents this by making the output write and offset commit atomic.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
WITHOUT EOS:
  Read event -> Process -> Write output
                              |
                     Crash before offset commit
                              |
                     Reprocess -> Duplicate output!

WITH EOS (transactional):
  Begin Transaction
    Read event
    Process
    Write output
    Commit consumer offset
  Commit Transaction (atomic)

  Crash at any point -> Transaction rolls back
  -> No duplicates
```

**Three components:**

1. **Idempotent producer:** Broker deduplicates by producer ID + sequence number
2. **Transactional producer:** Groups writes + offset commits into atomic transactions
3. **Read-committed consumer:** Only sees committed (not in-flight) messages

**Configuration:**

```java
// Producer
props.put("enable.idempotence", "true");
props.put("transactional.id", "order-processor");

// Consumer
props.put("isolation.level", "read_committed");
```

---

### Important Limitation

Kafka's exactly-once works **within Kafka only.** If your consumer reads from Kafka, writes to a database, and commits the offset - the database write and offset commit are NOT atomic. You still need idempotency for external systems.

3. For external systems, still need idempotent consumers

"Kafka's exactly-once semantics use idempotent producers and transactional processing to make output writes and offset commits atomic - but this only works within Kafka; for external systems I still implement idempotent consumers."

# Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)

**TL;DR** - A Dead Letter Queue captures messages that fail processing after exhausting retry attempts, preventing poison messages from blocking the queue while preserving them for investigation.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

A malformed message enters your queue. The consumer fails to process it. The message is redelivered. Fails again. Redelivered again. This loops forever, blocking all other messages behind it. The "poison pill" problem.

### 💻 Code Example

```java
// RabbitMQ DLQ configuration
@Bean
public Queue orderQueue() {
    return QueueBuilder.durable("orders")
        .deadLetterExchange("dlx")
        .deadLetterRoutingKey("orders.dead")
        .build();
}

@Bean
public Queue deadLetterQueue() {
    return QueueBuilder.durable("orders-dlq")
        .build();
}

// Spring Kafka DLQ with retry
@Configuration
public class KafkaConfig {
    @Bean
    public DefaultErrorHandler errorHandler(
            KafkaTemplate<String, Object> template) {
        var recovery = new DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer(
            template);
        return new DefaultErrorHandler(
            recovery,
            new FixedBackOff(1000L, 3)); // 3 retries
    }
}

// DLQ consumer for investigation
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events.DLT",
    groupId = "dlq-monitor")
public void handleDeadLetter(ConsumerRecord<?, ?> r) {
    log.error("Dead letter: topic={}, key={}, value={}",
        r.topic(), r.key(), r.value());
    alertService.notifyOnCall(
        "Dead letter received", r.toString());
}
```

---

### Best Practices

1. **Always configure DLQs** on production queues
2. **Set max retries** (typically 3-5) with exponential backoff
3. **Alert on DLQ messages** - they indicate bugs or data issues
4. **Preserve message metadata** (original topic, partition, offset, error reason)
5. **Build a DLQ dashboard** for operations to investigate and replay
6. **Replay capability** - ability to move messages from DLQ back to main queue after fixing the bug

  Need replay/event sourcing?
  |-- YES -> Kafka
  |
  Need complex routing?
  |-- YES -> RabbitMQ
  |
  AWS-only, minimal ops?
  |-- YES -> SQS/SNS
  |
  Need streaming + processing?
  |-- YES -> Kafka + Kafka Streams/Flink
  |
  Simple task queue?
  |-- YES -> SQS or RabbitMQ
  |
  Multi-protocol (MQTT, STOMP)?
  |-- YES -> RabbitMQ
