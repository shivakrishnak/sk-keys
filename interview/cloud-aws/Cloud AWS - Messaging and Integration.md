# SQS

**TL;DR** - SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a fully managed message queue for decoupling services - messages are stored durably until consumers process them, with Standard queues (at-least-once, best-effort ordering) and FIFO queues (exactly-once, strict ordering).

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Service A calls Service B synchronously. If B is down, A fails. If B is slow, A times out. If traffic spikes overwhelm B, both crash. No buffer, no retry, no decoupling. Producer and consumer must be available simultaneously.

---

### Textbook Definition

Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling of distributed system components. It stores messages until consumers retrieve and process them, providing at-least-once delivery (Standard) or exactly-once processing (FIFO), with automatic scaling, dead-letter queues for failed messages, and message retention up to 14 days.

### How It Works

```
SQS Standard vs FIFO:
  | Feature      | Standard          | FIFO              |
  |-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | Throughput  | Unlimited         | 3,000 msg/s       |
  | Ordering    | Best-effort       | Strict FIFO       |
  | Delivery    | At-least-once     | Exactly-once      |
  | Deduplication| None             | 5-min dedup window|
  | Cost        | $0.40/million     | $0.50/million     |

  Use Standard: high throughput, order doesn't matter
  Use FIFO: order matters, can't process duplicates

Message lifecycle:
  1. Producer sends message to queue
  2. Message stored (redundantly across AZs)
  3. Consumer polls queue (long polling preferred)
  4. Message received + visibility timeout starts
  5. Consumer processes message
  6. Consumer deletes message from queue
  7. If not deleted within visibility timeout:
     message becomes visible again (retry)

Key configurations:
  Visibility Timeout: 0s - 12hr (default 30s)
    Set to: 6x average processing time
  Message Retention: 1 min - 14 days (default 4 days)
  Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): failed messages after N retries
    maxReceiveCount: 3 (then move to DLQ)
  Long Polling: waitTimeSeconds=20 (reduce empty responses)
  Delay Queue: delay message visibility 0-15 min

SQS + Lambda pattern:
  SQS -> Lambda (event source mapping)
  - Lambda polls queue (managed by AWS)
  - Batch size: 1-10 messages per invocation
  - On failure: message returns to queue (retry)
  - After maxReceiveCount: moves to DLQ
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Standard = unlimited throughput, at-least-once (design for idempotent consumers). FIFO = strict order, exactly-once, 3000 msg/s limit.
2. Dead Letter Queue: always configure. After N failed processing attempts (maxReceiveCount), message goes to DLQ for investigation. Monitor DLQ depth.
3. Long polling (waitTimeSeconds=20): reduces costs and empty responses. Visibility timeout: set to 6x processing time to avoid duplicate processing.

**Interview one-liner:**
"SQS decouples services with durable message buffering - I use Standard queues with idempotent consumers for high throughput, FIFO when ordering matters, DLQs with alarms for failed messages, long polling to reduce costs, and Lambda event source mappings for serverless processing."

# SNS

**TL;DR** - SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a pub/sub messaging service for fan-out - one message published to a topic is delivered to all subscribers (SQS queues, Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email, SMS) enabling event-driven architectures.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Service A needs to notify Services B, C, and D of an event. Without pub/sub, A must know about and call each service directly. Adding Service E requires changing A's code. Tight coupling, fan-out complexity, and service discovery problems.

---

### Textbook Definition

Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service where publishers send messages to topics, and all subscribers to that topic receive the message. It supports multiple subscriber types (SQS, Lambda, HTTP/S, email, SMS, mobile push), message filtering, and FIFO topics for ordered delivery.

### How It Works

```
SNS pub/sub model:
  Publisher -> SNS Topic -> Fan-out to all subscribers:
    -> SQS Queue A (order processing)
    -> SQS Queue B (analytics)
    -> Lambda (send notification)
    -> HTTP endpoint (webhook)

  Key: Publisher doesn't know/care about subscribers
       Adding subscribers requires no publisher changes

SNS + SQS Fan-out pattern (most common):
  Order Service -> SNS "order-placed" topic
    -> SQS: Fulfillment queue (pick and pack)
    -> SQS: Billing queue (charge customer)
    -> SQS: Analytics queue (update dashboards)
    -> Lambda: Send confirmation email

  Why SQS after SNS? (not Lambda directly)
    - SQS buffers (Lambda can throttle under load)
    - SQS retries (DLQ for failed processing)
    - SQS batching (process multiple at once)

Message filtering (subscription-level):
  Topic: "order-events"
  Subscriber A filter: {"event_type": ["order_placed"]}
  Subscriber B filter: {"event_type": ["order_shipped"]}
  Subscriber C filter: {"amount": [{"numeric": [">", 100]}]}
  (Subscribers only receive messages matching their filter)

SNS Standard vs FIFO:
  Standard: Best-effort ordering, at-least-once
  FIFO: Strict ordering, exactly-once, FIFO SQS only
        300 msg/s (3000 with batching)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. SNS = fan-out (one message, many subscribers). SQS = point-to-point (one message, one consumer). SNS + SQS = fan-out with buffering (best pattern).
2. Message filtering at subscription level: subscribers only receive relevant messages. Avoids each subscriber filtering server-side.
3. Common pattern: domain event published to SNS topic -> multiple SQS queues for different consumers. Decouples event producers from consumers entirely.

**Interview one-liner:**
"SNS provides pub/sub fan-out for event-driven architectures - I use SNS+SQS for durable fan-out (each consumer has its own queue with DLQ), message filtering to reduce consumer processing, and FIFO topics when ordering matters across subscribers."

# EventBridge

**TL;DR** - EventBridge is a serverless event bus for building event-driven architectures - it routes events from AWS services, SaaS apps, and custom sources to targets using rules with filtering, transformation, scheduling, and schema discovery.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
SNS requires you to publish events explicitly. AWS service events (EC2 state changes, CodePipeline failures) have no unified way to react to them. No event schema registry. No event replay. No scheduled event-driven actions.

---

### Textbook Definition

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that connects applications using events. It receives events from AWS services (native integration), SaaS partners, and custom applications, then routes them to targets (Lambda, SQS, Step Functions, etc.) based on content-based filtering rules, with built-in schema discovery, event archive/replay, and scheduling.

---

### How It Works

```
EventBridge architecture:
  Event Sources -> Event Bus -> Rules -> Targets
    AWS services (200+ native)     Lambda
    Custom applications            SQS/SNS
    SaaS partners (Zendesk, etc)   Step Functions
    Scheduled (cron/rate)          API destinations

Event structure (JSON envelope):
  {
    "source": "com.myapp.orders",
    "detail-type": "OrderPlaced",
    "detail": {
      "orderId": "12345",
      "amount": 99.99,
      "customerId": "C-001"
    }
  }

Rule with content-based filtering:
  {
    "source": ["com.myapp.orders"],
    "detail-type": ["OrderPlaced"],
    "detail": {
      "amount": [{"numeric": [">", 100]}]
    }
  }
  -> Target: Lambda "high-value-order-handler"

EventBridge vs SNS:
  | Feature         | EventBridge       | SNS               |
  |----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | AWS service events | Native (200+)  | Manual publish    |
  | Schema registry | Yes               | No                |
  | Event replay    | Yes (archive)     | No                |
  | Scheduling      | Built-in cron     | No                |
  | SaaS integration| Yes               | No                |
  | Throughput      | Soft limits       | Very high         |
  | Latency        | ~500ms            | ~20-50ms          |
  | Cost           | $1/million events | $0.50/million     |

When to use EventBridge vs SNS:
  EventBridge: AWS service reactions, SaaS events,
    complex routing, scheduling, schema management
  SNS: High throughput fan-out, simple pub/sub,
    low latency requirements, mobile push/SMS/email
```

2. Use EventBridge for: reacting to AWS service events, event-driven scheduling (cron), complex event routing, and when you need archive/replay for debugging.
3. EventBridge vs SNS: EventBridge for routing complexity and AWS events. SNS for high-throughput fan-out and low latency. They're complementary, not competitors.

**Interview one-liner:**
"EventBridge is my default event bus for event-driven architectures - native AWS service event integration, content-based routing rules, event schemas, and archive/replay for debugging - with SNS+SQS for high-throughput fan-out where EventBridge's latency or throughput limits are a concern."

# Step Functions

**TL;DR** - Step Functions is a serverless workflow orchestrator that coordinates multiple AWS services into visual state machines - handling sequencing, branching, error handling, retries, parallelism, and human approvals with built-in execution history.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Complex workflows (order processing: validate -> charge -> fulfill -> notify) implemented in a single Lambda become a 2000-line spaghetti function. Error handling, retries, state management, and timeout logic obscure business logic.

---

### Textbook Definition

AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS services (Lambda, ECS, SQS, DynamoDB, etc.) into resilient workflows defined as state machines using Amazon States Language (ASL). It provides visual workflow monitoring, built-in error handling with retry/catch, parallel execution, choice branching, and wait states.

---

### How It Works

```
State types in Step Functions:
  Task:    Execute work (Lambda, ECS, SDK integration)
  Choice:  Branch based on condition (if/else)
  Parallel: Execute branches simultaneously
  Map:     Iterate over array (for-each)
  Wait:    Pause for time or until timestamp
  Pass:    Transform data (no external call)
  Succeed/Fail: Terminal states

Example: Order processing workflow
  StartAt: ValidateOrder
  States:
    ValidateOrder -> (Task: Lambda)
      Success -> CheckInventory
      Fail -> OrderRejected
    CheckInventory -> (Task: Lambda)
      In stock -> ProcessPayment
      Out of stock -> BackOrder
    ProcessPayment -> (Task: Lambda, retry 3x)
      Success -> Parallel:
        [FulfillOrder, SendConfirmation, UpdateAnalytics]
      PaymentFailed -> NotifyCustomer

Standard vs Express:
  | Feature   | Standard         | Express            |
  |-----------|------------------|--------------------|
  | Duration  | Up to 1 year     | Up to 5 minutes    |

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Step Functions = visual workflow orchestration. States: Task (do work), Choice (branch), Parallel (fan-out), Map (iterate), Wait (pause). Replaces complex Lambda orchestration.
2. Built-in retry with exponential backoff per error type. Catch for routing to error handlers. No retry logic needed in your Lambda code.
3. Standard (up to 1 year, exactly-once, audit trail) vs Express (up to 5 min, high-volume, cheaper for short workflows). Use Standard for order processing, Express for real-time stream processing.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Step Functions orchestrates multi-service workflows as visual state machines - I use Standard workflows for long-running processes (order fulfillment, approvals) with built-in retry/catch replacing custom error handling, Map state for batch processing, and Express for high-volume short-lived workflows."

# Kinesis

**TL;DR** - Amazon Kinesis is a platform for real-time streaming data - ingesting, processing, and analyzing hundreds of thousands of records per second for use cases like log aggregation, real-time analytics, IoT telemetry, and clickstream processing.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Real-time data arrives continuously (clicks, logs, sensor readings). Batch processing means insights are hours old. SQS is point-to-point (one consumer reads each message). You need multiple consumers to read the same stream independently with ordering guarantees.

---

### Textbook Definition

Amazon Kinesis is a managed platform for streaming data. **Kinesis Data Streams** provides ordered, replayable streams with multiple consumers. **Kinesis Data Firehose** delivers streaming data to destinations (S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch) without writing consumer code. **Kinesis Data Analytics** processes streams using SQL or Apache Flink.

### How It Works

```
Kinesis Data Streams:
  Producer -> Shard 1 -> Consumer A (real-time dashboard)
              Shard 2 -> Consumer B (write to S3)
              Shard N -> Consumer C (anomaly detection)

  Shard = unit of capacity:
    Write: 1 MB/s or 1,000 records/s per shard
    Read: 2 MB/s per shard (shared) or dedicated (enhanced)
    Data retention: 24 hours (default) to 365 days

  Partition key determines shard:
    partition_key = "user-123" -> hash -> shard assignment
    Same partition key = same shard = ordered

  Multiple independent consumers (unlike SQS):
    Consumer A: Real-time processing
    Consumer B: Archive to S3
    Consumer C: Analytics pipeline
    Each has its own position in the stream

Kinesis vs SQS:
  | Feature       | Kinesis Streams  | SQS              |
  |---------------|-----------------|------------------|
  | Model         | Streaming       | Queue            |
  | Consumers     | Multiple (fan-out)| Single          |
  | Ordering      | Per-shard       | FIFO only        |
  | Replay        | Yes (retention) | No (deleted)     |
  | Throughput    | Shard-based     | Unlimited        |
  | Latency       | ~200ms          | ~20ms            |
  | Use case      | Real-time stream| Task queue       |

Kinesis Data Firehose (simplest):
  Source -> Firehose -> Transform (optional Lambda)
    -> Destination: S3 / Redshift / Elasticsearch / Splunk
  No consumer code needed. Buffer by size or time.
  Use for: log delivery, data lake ingestion
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Kinesis Streams = ordered, replayable, multiple consumers per stream. SQS = queue (one consumer per message, no replay). Different tools for different patterns.
2. Shard = unit of capacity (1 MB/s write, 2 MB/s read). Scale by adding shards. Partition key determines ordering within a shard.
3. Firehose = zero-code delivery to S3/Redshift/Elasticsearch. Use Firehose when you just need data landed somewhere. Use Streams when you need real-time processing with custom consumers.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Kinesis Data Streams for real-time ordered event processing with multiple independent consumers (clickstreams, IoT, logs), Firehose for zero-code delivery to data lakes (S3/Redshift), with shard count sized to throughput needs and enhanced fan-out for latency-sensitive consumers."

# MSK

**TL;DR** - Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) runs fully managed Kafka clusters - handling broker provisioning, patching, replication, and ZooKeeper/KRaft management - giving you Apache Kafka API compatibility without operational overhead.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Self-managed Kafka: provision EC2 instances, configure ZooKeeper, manage broker configs, handle replication, plan storage, patch security vulnerabilities, set up monitoring. Operational burden is enormous for a small team.

---

### Textbook Definition

Amazon MSK is a fully managed service for Apache Kafka that manages the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of Kafka clusters. It provides full Kafka API compatibility, automatic broker replacement, storage auto-scaling, integration with AWS security (IAM auth, encryption), and MSK Connect for managed Kafka Connect connectors.

**Level 5 - Distinguished (expert thinking):**

---

### How It Works

```
MSK architecture:
  MSK Cluster (managed by AWS):
    Broker 1 (AZ-a) | Broker 2 (AZ-b) | Broker 3 (AZ-c)
    ZooKeeper/KRaft: managed, not accessible to you
    Storage: EBS-backed, auto-scaling optional

  You manage:
    - Topics (create, configure retention, partitions)
    - Producers and consumers (your application code)
    - Consumer group offsets and processing logic
    - Schema registry (Glue Schema Registry or self-managed)

  AWS manages:
    - Broker hardware and OS patching
    - ZooKeeper/KRaft cluster
    - Broker replacement on failure
    - Storage scaling
    - Monitoring integration (CloudWatch)

MSK vs Kinesis Data Streams:
  | Feature          | MSK (Kafka)      | Kinesis          |
  |-----------------|------------------|------------------|
  | Protocol        | Kafka protocol   | AWS SDK          |
  | Ecosystem       | Huge (Kafka Connect, Streams) | AWS-native |
  | Management      | Managed cluster  | Serverless       |
  | Pricing         | Per-broker-hour  | Per-shard-hour   |
  | Retention       | Unlimited (disk) | Max 365 days     |
  | Consumer groups | Native           | Limited          |
  | Portability     | Any Kafka client | AWS SDK only     |

When to use MSK:
  - Existing Kafka ecosystem (Connect, Streams, ksqlDB)
  - Need Kafka protocol compatibility
  - Migrating from self-managed Kafka
  - Kafka Connect for CDC (Debezium)
  - Complex stream processing (Kafka Streams)

When to use Kinesis:
  - Serverless (no cluster management)
  - Simple fan-out or S3 delivery (Firehose)
  - AWS-native integration preferred
  - Variable throughput (pay per use)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. MSK = managed Kafka (full API compatibility, Kafka ecosystem). Kinesis = AWS-native streaming (serverless, simpler, AWS-only). Choose based on ecosystem needs.
2. MSK manages brokers/ZooKeeper/patching/storage. You manage topics, producers, consumers, and schemas. Still need Kafka expertise.
3. Use MSK when: existing Kafka investment, need Kafka Connect (Debezium CDC), Kafka Streams processing, or multi-cloud portability of streaming logic.

**Interview one-liner:**
"MSK for teams invested in the Kafka ecosystem needing managed infrastructure (Kafka Connect for CDC, Kafka Streams for processing, Schema Registry for evolution), Kinesis for serverless streaming with simpler AWS-native integration - choice depends on existing expertise and portability requirements."
