# RDS

**TL;DR** - Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) manages relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB) handling provisioning, patching, backups, replication, and failover - so you focus on schema and queries, not infrastructure.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Managing a production database means: OS patching, storage provisioning, backup scheduling, replication setup, failover automation, security patches, monitoring disk space, performance tuning the OS layer. All before writing a single query.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that automates hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. It supports Multi-AZ deployments for high availability (synchronous standby), Read Replicas for read scaling (asynchronous), automated backups with point-in-time recovery, and encryption at rest and in transit.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
RDS Architecture:
  Primary Instance (AZ-a):
    - Handles all reads and writes
    - Automated backups to S3
    - Synchronous replication -> Standby (AZ-b)

  Multi-AZ Failover:
    Primary fails -> Standby promoted (60-120 sec)
    DNS endpoint auto-switches (no app changes)

  Read Replicas (separate from Multi-AZ):
    Primary -> async replication -> Replica 1, 2, ... 5
    Each has its own endpoint
    Can promote replica to standalone (DR)
    Can be cross-region (global reads)

RDS vs Aurora vs Self-Managed:
  | Feature       | Self-Managed | RDS       | Aurora      |
  |---------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
  | Ops effort    | High        | Low       | Lowest      |
  | HA failover   | You build   | 60-120s   | <30s        |
  | Read replicas | You build   | Up to 5   | Up to 15    |
  | Storage       | You manage  | EBS-based | Distributed |
  | Cost          | EC2 cost    | ~20% more | ~20% > RDS  |
  | Compatibility | Full        | Almost    | MySQL/PG    |

Key configurations:
  Instance class: db.r6g.xlarge (memory-optimized)
  Storage: gp3 (SSD, burstable) or io2 (provisioned IOPS)
  Backup: 0-35 day retention, point-in-time recovery
  Encryption: KMS at rest, TLS in transit
  Parameter groups: DB engine tuning (max_connections)
```

2. Automated backups: daily snapshots + transaction logs = point-in-time recovery to any second within retention window (up to 35 days).
3. Storage: gp3 for general workloads (3000 IOPS baseline free), io2 for latency-sensitive (provisioned IOPS). Monitor FreeStorageSpace and ReadLatency.

# DynamoDB

**TL;DR** - DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL key-value and document database delivering single-digit millisecond performance at any scale, with auto-scaling, built-in replication, and a pay-per-request pricing model that eliminates capacity planning.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Relational databases struggle with massive scale: sharding is complex, joins become expensive, schema changes on billion-row tables take hours. You need predictable single-digit-ms latency regardless of table size.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value and document NoSQL database designed for single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Data is automatically replicated across three AZs, with support for on-demand or provisioned capacity, global tables (multi-region active-active), DynamoDB Streams for change data capture, and DAX for microsecond caching.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
DynamoDB data model:
  Table: Collection of items
  Item:  Row (max 400KB)
  Attribute: Column (flexible schema)

  Primary Key options:
    Partition Key (PK): Hash-based distribution
    Partition Key + Sort Key (SK): Range queries within PK

  Access patterns drive design:
    PK = UserID, SK = OrderDate#OrderID
    Query: All orders for user in date range
    GetItem: Specific user + specific order (fastest)

  Secondary Indexes:
    GSI: Different PK+SK, eventually consistent
    LSI: Same PK, different SK, strongly consistent

Capacity modes:
  On-Demand:    Pay per request ($1.25/million writes)
                No capacity planning. Good for spiky/new.
  Provisioned:  Set RCU/WCU. Cheaper for predictable.
                Auto-scaling adjusts within minutes.

Key features:
  - Single-digit ms latency at any scale
  - DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator): microsecond cache
  - Global Tables: multi-region active-active
  - Streams: ordered change log (trigger Lambda)
  - TTL: auto-delete expired items (free)
  - Transactions: ACID across multiple items

When to use / avoid:
  USE:  Known access patterns, high scale, key-value
        lookups, session stores, gaming leaderboards
  AVOID: Ad-hoc queries, complex joins, small dataset
         with complex relationships (use RDS instead)
```

**ONE-LINER:** [TODO]

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Design for access patterns FIRST. Single-table design: one table, multiple entity types, PK+SK combinations enable all queries. No joins - denormalize.
2. On-Demand for unpredictable/new workloads. Provisioned + Auto Scaling for predictable (30% cheaper). DAX for microsecond reads.
3. Partition key choice is critical: high cardinality (UserID good, Status bad). Hot partition = throttling even with unused capacity elsewhere.

**Interview one-liner:**
"DynamoDB delivers single-digit ms at any scale - I design single-table models around access patterns (PK/SK combinations for all queries), use GSIs for alternative access patterns, On-Demand for spiky workloads, Streams for event-driven processing, and monitor ConsumedCapacity with partition key distribution."

# ElastiCache

**TL;DR** - ElastiCache provides managed Redis or Memcached for microsecond-latency caching - reducing database load, storing sessions, and enabling real-time features like leaderboards, with Multi-AZ replication and automatic failover.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Database queries take 5-50ms. Under load, the database becomes the bottleneck. Repeated queries for the same data waste compute. Sessions stored in-memory are lost on server restart or can't be shared across instances.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Amazon ElastiCache is a managed in-memory caching service supporting Redis and Memcached. It delivers sub-millisecond response times for read-heavy workloads by caching frequently accessed data, with Redis offering persistence, replication, pub/sub, and data structures, and Memcached offering simpler multi-threaded caching.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Redis vs Memcached:
  | Feature         | Redis           | Memcached        |
  |----------------|-----------------|------------------|
  | Data structures | Rich (sets, sorted sets, lists) | Simple key-value |
  | Persistence    | Yes (AOF, RDB)  | No               |
  | Replication    | Yes (Multi-AZ)  | No               |
  | Pub/Sub        | Yes             | No               |
  | Transactions   | Yes (MULTI)     | No               |
  | Clustering     | Redis Cluster   | Client-side      |
  | Use case       | Sessions, queues, leaderboards | Simple caching  |

  Almost always choose Redis (93% of cases)

Caching patterns:
  Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):
    1. App checks cache
    2. Cache hit -> return (microseconds)
    3. Cache miss -> query DB -> store in cache -> return
    Pros: Only caches what's needed
    Cons: First request always slow (cold cache)

  Write-Through:
    1. App writes to cache AND DB simultaneously
    2. Reads always hit cache (always fresh)
    Pros: Cache always current
    Cons: Write penalty, caches unused data

  TTL (Time-To-Live):
    Set expiration on cached items
    Balance: short TTL = fresh data, more DB hits
             long TTL = stale data, fewer DB hits

ElastiCache Redis architecture:
  Primary (AZ-a) <- writes
    -> Replica (AZ-b) <- reads (read scaling)
    -> Replica (AZ-c) <- reads
  Automatic failover: replica promoted if primary fails
```

2. Cache-aside pattern: check cache first, on miss query DB and populate cache. Set TTL to balance freshness vs DB load.
3. Common use cases: session store (shared across instances), DB query cache (reduce load), rate limiting (INCR + EXPIRE), leaderboards (sorted sets), pub/sub.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I use ElastiCache Redis with Multi-AZ replication for session storage (shared, persistent), database query caching (cache-aside with TTL), and real-time features (sorted sets for leaderboards) - monitoring cache hit ratio (>95% target), evictions, and memory usage."

# S3 Storage Classes

**TL;DR** - S3 offers six storage classes with different cost/access trade-offs - from Standard (frequent access, highest cost) to Glacier Deep Archive (rarely accessed, lowest cost) - with Lifecycle Policies automating transitions to optimize costs.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
All data stored at the same cost regardless of access frequency. 90% of data is rarely accessed but costs the same as frequently accessed data. No automated way to move data to cheaper storage as it ages.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

S3 Storage Classes provide different cost/performance tiers for objects based on access frequency. Lifecycle Policies automatically transition objects between classes based on age or access patterns, enabling cost optimization without application changes. Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between tiers based on actual access.

  | Deep Archive      | <1x/yr  | $0.00099| $0.02/GB  | 180 days    |

Lifecycle Policy example:
  Rule: "Archive old logs"
  - Day 0-30: Standard (active logs)
  - Day 30-90: Standard-IA (recent but rarely read)
  - Day 90-365: Glacier Instant (compliance, rare access)
  - Day 365+: Deep Archive (legal hold, almost never)
  - Day 730: Delete (retention expired)

Intelligent-Tiering (set and forget):
  Monitors access per object automatically:
  - Frequent Access tier (accessed in 30 days)
  - Infrequent Access tier (not accessed 30 days)
  - Archive Instant tier (not accessed 90 days)
  - Archive tier (not accessed 90+ days, optional)
  - Deep Archive tier (not accessed 180+ days, optional)
  Cost: $0.0025 per 1,000 objects/month monitoring fee
  Best for: unpredictable access patterns, large datasets

Key constraints:
  - Min storage duration: charged even if deleted early
  - Min object size: 128KB for IA classes (charged min)
  - Retrieval costs: Glacier Flexible = minutes to hours
  - One Zone-IA: cheaper but no cross-AZ redundancy
```

# EBS and EFS

**TL;DR** - EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent block storage for single EC2 instances (like a virtual hard drive), while EFS (Elastic File System) provides shared NFS file storage accessible by multiple instances simultaneously across AZs.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
EC2 instance store is ephemeral (lost on stop/terminate). You need persistent storage that survives instance lifecycle. Some workloads need shared file access across multiple instances (content management, ML training data).

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

**EBS**: Persistent block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances within a single AZ, offering SSD-backed (gp3, io2) and HDD-backed (st1, sc1) types with snapshot capabilities. **EFS**: Fully managed, elastic NFS file system that scales automatically and is accessible from multiple EC2 instances/containers across AZs simultaneously.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
EBS vs EFS vs S3:
  | Feature       | EBS           | EFS          | S3           |
  |---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
  | Type          | Block storage | File storage | Object store |
  | Access        | Single EC2    | Multiple EC2 | Any (HTTP)   |
  | AZ scope      | Single AZ     | Regional     | Regional     |
  | Performance   | Lowest latency| Good         | Higher latency|
  | Scaling       | Manual resize | Automatic    | Unlimited    |
  | Use case      | Boot volumes, DBs | Shared files, CMS | Backups, data lake |
  | Cost ($/GB)   | $0.08 (gp3)  | $0.30 (Std)  | $0.023       |

EBS volume types:
  gp3: General purpose SSD - 3000 IOPS baseline (free!)
       Most workloads. 125 MB/s. Can provision up to 16K IOPS.
  io2: Provisioned IOPS SSD - up to 64K IOPS
       Databases needing consistent I/O. Multi-attach possible.
  st1: Throughput optimized HDD - big data, log processing
       500 MB/s, cheap. Sequential reads.
  sc1: Cold HDD - infrequent access, cheapest
       Archival, backups on block storage.

EFS features:
  - Scales from 0 to PB automatically
  - Multi-AZ by default (highly available)
  - NFSv4.1 protocol (POSIX-compliant)
  - Lifecycle management (IA tier after 30 days)
  - Throughput modes: bursting, provisioned, elastic
  - Access points (per-app directory + permissions)
  - Works with ECS/EKS (shared container storage)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

2. EBS gp3 is the default: 3000 IOPS + 125 MB/s included free (regardless of volume size). Only upgrade to io2 if you need >16K IOPS.
3. EFS is expensive ($0.30/GB vs $0.08/GB EBS). Use EFS Infrequent Access lifecycle policy (auto-moves files not accessed in 30 days, 92% cheaper).

**Interview one-liner:**
"EBS gp3 for single-instance block storage (databases, boot volumes) with free 3000 IOPS baseline, EFS for shared file access across instances/containers with automatic scaling, and I always enable EFS IA lifecycle policies to reduce cost on infrequently accessed files."

# Aurora

**TL;DR** - Amazon Aurora is a MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible database engine with 5x throughput improvement, auto-scaling storage up to 128TB, up to 15 read replicas with sub-10ms lag, and faster failover (<30s) - at only ~20% more cost than standard RDS.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Standard RDS has limitations: EBS-based storage (limited IOPS), 5 read replicas max, 60-120s failover, single-AZ storage. You need enterprise-grade performance without managing Oracle/SQL Server licensing.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, combining the performance and availability of commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source. It features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 128TB, replicates six ways across three AZs, and provides up to 15 low-latency read replicas.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Aurora architecture (key innovation = storage layer):
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Compute Layer (decoupled from storage)   |
  | Primary (writes) | Replicas (reads, 1-15)|
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Aurora Storage Layer                     |
  | 6 copies across 3 AZs                   |
  | 10GB segments, auto-scales to 128TB     |
  | 4/6 quorum writes, 3/6 quorum reads     |
  | Self-healing, continuous backup to S3    |
  +------------------------------------------+

Aurora vs Standard RDS:
  | Feature       | RDS MySQL/PG  | Aurora          |
  |---------------|---------------|-----------------|
  | Throughput    | Baseline      | 5x MySQL        |
  | Storage       | EBS (max 64TB)| Distributed 128TB|
  | Replicas      | Up to 5       | Up to 15        |
  | Replica lag   | Seconds       | < 10ms          |
  | Failover      | 60-120s       | < 30s           |
  | Backups       | EBS snapshots | Continuous to S3|
  | Cost          | Baseline      | ~20% more       |
  | Storage scale | Manual        | Automatic       |

Aurora Serverless v2:
  - Auto-scales compute (0.5 to 128 ACUs)
  - Scales in seconds (not minutes)
  - Pay per ACU-second
  - Use for: variable workloads, dev/test, new apps

Aurora Global Database:
  - Primary region: read/write
  - Secondary regions: read (< 1s replication)
  - Disaster recovery: promote secondary (< 1 min)
  - Use for: global reads, cross-region DR
