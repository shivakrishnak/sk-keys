# AI Agents

**TL;DR** - AI agents are LLM-powered systems that autonomously plan, execute actions, observe results, and iterate toward a goal - going beyond single-turn Q&A to handle multi-step tasks by reasoning about which tools to use and when to stop.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
LLMs alone can only generate text. They can't browse the web, query databases, execute code, or take actions in the real world. Complex tasks requiring multiple steps, tool use, and adaptive planning need an orchestration layer around the LLM.

---

### How It Works

```
Agent loop (ReAct pattern):
  Goal: "Find the cheapest flight to Tokyo next week"

  Loop:
    1. THINK: What do I need to do next?
       "I need to search flights. Let me use the flight API."
    2. ACT: Choose and execute a tool
       flight_search(dest="TYO", dates="next_week")
    3. OBSERVE: Process tool result
       "Found 5 flights: $800, $950, $1100, $750, $900"
    4. THINK: Is the goal complete?
       "The cheapest is $750 on ANA. Let me verify dates."
    5. ACT: Verify details
       flight_details(id="ANA-123")
    6. OBSERVE: "March 15, 14:30, Haneda"
    7. THINK: "I have all info. Goal complete."
    8. RESPOND: "Cheapest flight: ANA $750, Mar 15..."

Agent architectures:
  ReAct (Reason + Act):
    Think -> Act -> Observe -> Think -> ...
    Simple, effective for most tasks

  Plan-then-Execute:
    Create full plan upfront -> Execute steps in order
    Better for complex multi-step tasks

  Reflexion:
    Execute -> Evaluate result -> Reflect on mistakes
    -> Retry with learned lessons
    Self-improving through reflection

Components of an agent:
  +------------------------------------------+
  | LLM (Brain): Reasoning, planning, deciding|
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Tools: APIs, databases, code execution    |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Memory: Conversation history, past results|
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Orchestrator: Loop control, error handling|
  +------------------------------------------+

When to use agents vs simple RAG:
  RAG: Single retrieval + generation (one-step)
  Agent: Multi-step, tool use, adaptive execution
  Rule: If task needs >1 LLM call with decisions
        between calls, consider an agent architecture
```

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Agents = LLM + Tools + Loop. The LLM reasons about what to do, tools execute actions, and the loop continues until the goal is met or a limit is hit.
2. ReAct (Reason + Act) is the standard pattern: Think (what to do) -> Act (use tool) -> Observe (process result) -> Repeat. Simple and effective for most use cases.
3. Agents are unreliable without guardrails: max iterations, cost limits, output validation, tool permission scoping. Production agents need extensive error handling and human-in-the-loop for risky actions.

**Interview one-liner:**
"AI agents extend LLMs with autonomous tool use and iterative reasoning via the ReAct loop - I build them with scoped tool permissions, max iteration limits, cost controls, structured output validation, and human-in-the-loop for irreversible actions, choosing agent complexity only when tasks genuinely require multi-step adaptive execution."

# Tool Use and Function Calling

**TL;DR** - Function calling allows LLMs to select and invoke structured tools (APIs, databases, code execution) by generating JSON arguments matching predefined schemas - the mechanism that transforms LLMs from text generators into action-taking systems.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
LLM outputs are just text strings. "Check the weather in Tokyo" produces a text description, not an actual API call. You need a structured way for models to indicate which function to call with which parameters, validated against a schema.

---

### How It Works

```
Function calling flow:
  1. Define tools (JSON schema):
     {
       "name": "get_weather",
       "description": "Get weather for a location",
       "parameters": {
         "type": "object",
         "properties": {
           "location": {"type": "string"},
           "unit": {"enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]}
         },
         "required": ["location"]
       }
     }

  2. User asks: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"

  3. LLM responds with function call (not text):
     {"name": "get_weather",
      "arguments": {"location": "Tokyo", "unit": "celsius"}}

  4. Your code executes the function:
     result = weather_api.get("Tokyo", unit="celsius")
     -> {"temp": 22, "condition": "sunny"}

  5. Feed result back to LLM:
     "The weather in Tokyo is 22C and sunny."

Best practices:
  - Clear, specific tool descriptions (LLM reads these!)
  - Constrained parameter types (enum > free string)
  - Validate ALL outputs before execution (don't trust)
  - Separate read tools from write tools (safety)
  - Log every tool call for debugging and audit

Tool design principles:
  - Single responsibility: one tool = one action
  - Clear naming: search_database not do_thing
  - Comprehensive descriptions: include examples
  - Fail gracefully: return errors, not exceptions
  - Idempotent when possible (safe to retry)

Common tool categories:
  Information: search, lookup, calculate, read_file
  Action: send_email, create_ticket, update_database
  Code: execute_python, run_sql, run_shell
  (Action tools need extra safety - confirmation, limits)
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Function calling = LLM generates structured JSON (tool name + arguments) instead of text. Your code executes, feeds results back. The LLM decides WHICH tool and WITH WHAT parameters.
2. Tool descriptions are prompts: the model reads them to decide when to use each tool. Write clear, specific descriptions with examples. Bad descriptions = wrong tool selection.
3. Never trust tool call arguments blindly: validate types, check permissions, sanitize inputs before execution. The LLM can hallucinate parameters or attempt unintended actions.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Function calling enables LLMs to invoke structured tools via JSON schema - I design tools with single responsibility, clear descriptions (the model reads these for selection), strict parameter validation before execution, separate read/write permissions, and comprehensive logging for debugging and security audit."

# Planning Patterns

**TL;DR** - Planning patterns determine how agents decompose complex goals into executable steps - from simple sequential plans to tree-based exploration, adaptive replanning, and hierarchical task decomposition - the choice of planning strategy directly affects reliability and efficiency.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
An agent asked to "set up a production deployment" doesn't know to first check prerequisites, then configure infrastructure, then deploy code, then verify health. Without planning, agents either try everything at once (chaotic) or get stuck on the first obstacle.

---

### How It Works

```
Planning patterns (simplest to most complex):

1. Linear Plan (Sequential):
   Goal -> [Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, ..., Step N]
   Execute in order. If step fails, stop or retry.
   Best for: Well-defined procedures, known steps

2. ReAct (No explicit plan):
   Decide next action one step at a time
   Based on current observation + goal
   Best for: Exploratory tasks, unknown number of steps

3. Plan-then-Execute:
   Phase 1: LLM creates complete plan
   Phase 2: Execute each step
   Phase 3: Verify results match plan
   Best for: Complex tasks needing coordination

4. Adaptive Replanning:
   Create initial plan -> Execute step -> Observe
   -> Is plan still valid? If not, replan
   Best for: Dynamic environments, uncertain outcomes

5. Hierarchical Task Decomposition:
   High-level goal -> Sub-goals -> Atomic tasks
   "Deploy app" -> ["Build", "Test", "Deploy", "Verify"]
   "Build" -> ["Install deps", "Compile", "Package"]
   Best for: Very complex tasks, team of agents

Planning reliability techniques:
  - Verification steps: After each action, verify it worked
  - Rollback plan: If step N fails, undo steps 1..N-1
  - Timeout per step: Don't let one step block forever
  - Human checkpoint: Pause before irreversible actions
  - Fallback plans: If approach A fails, try approach B

Example - Plan-then-Execute:
  User: "Analyze this dataset and create a report"
  Plan:
    1. Load and inspect dataset (tool: read_file)
    2. Compute summary statistics (tool: execute_python)
    3. Identify key insights (reasoning)
    4. Generate visualizations (tool: execute_python)
    5. Write report (generation)
    6. Save report (tool: write_file)
  Execute: Steps 1-6 with observation between each
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Simple tasks: ReAct (decide one step at a time). Complex tasks: Plan-then-Execute (create full plan, then follow it). Dynamic environments: Adaptive Replanning (replan when observations don't match expectations).
2. Always include verification steps in plans: "do X, then verify X worked." Without verification, agents proceed on assumptions and compound errors.
3. Planning reliability = limiting blast radius: max steps, timeouts, rollback capability, human checkpoints for irreversible actions. Plans should be inspectable and interruptible.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I select planning patterns based on task complexity - ReAct for exploratory tasks, Plan-then-Execute for defined multi-step workflows, adaptive replanning when outcomes are uncertain - always with verification steps, rollback capability, max iteration limits, and human-in-the-loop for irreversible actions."

# Multi-Agent Systems

**TL;DR** - Multi-agent systems use multiple specialized LLM agents that collaborate, delegate, and coordinate to solve complex tasks - each agent has a focused role (researcher, coder, reviewer) enabling better task decomposition, specialization, and error checking than a single agent.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
One agent with 50 tools and a complex task gets confused. Its context window fills up. It tries to do everything and does nothing well. Complex workflows need different "experts" - one for research, one for coding, one for review.

---

### How It Works

```
Multi-agent patterns:

1. Supervisor (hierarchical):
   Supervisor agent decides which worker to call
   +-- Researcher agent (search, read docs)
   +-- Coder agent (write code, run tests)
   +-- Reviewer agent (check quality, suggest fixes)
   Best for: Well-defined roles, clear delegation

2. Debate (adversarial):
   Agent A proposes -> Agent B critiques -> Agent A revises
   Improves quality through structured disagreement
   Best for: Decision-making, content quality

3. Pipeline (sequential):
   Agent 1 (draft) -> Agent 2 (review) -> Agent 3 (polish)
   Each transforms the output of the previous
   Best for: Multi-stage content creation

4. Collaborative (peer):
   Multiple agents share workspace, coordinate freely
   No hierarchy - consensus-based decisions
   Best for: Research, brainstorming, exploration

Frameworks:
  | Framework  | Pattern    | Strength          |
  |-----------|-----------|-------------------|
  | CrewAI    | Role-based | Simple, intuitive |
  | AutoGen   | Conversational| Flexible, research|
  | LangGraph | Graph-based| Complex workflows  |
  | Swarm (OpenAI) | Handoff | Lightweight       |

Design considerations:
  - Fewer agents = simpler, more reliable
    (Start with 2-3, not 10)
  - Each agent needs: clear role, specific tools, focused
    system prompt, limited scope
  - Communication protocol: structured messages, not
    free-form text between agents
  - Error propagation: one agent's mistake affects all
    downstream agents (validation between steps!)
  - Cost multiplier: N agents = ~N x single agent cost
  - Debugging: trace which agent made which decision
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Multi-agent when a single agent has too many tools/responsibilities or when you need adversarial review (one generates, another critiques). Start with 2-3 agents, not 10.
2. Supervisor pattern is most production-ready: one orchestrator decides which specialist to invoke. Clear delegation, controllable, debuggable.
3. Cost and complexity multiply with agents. Each agent call = LLM invocation. Use multi-agent for genuinely complex tasks, not for things a single well-prompted agent could handle.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Multi-agent systems decompose complex tasks among specialized agents (researcher, coder, reviewer) coordinated by a supervisor - I keep agent count minimal (2-3), use structured communication protocols, validate outputs between agents, and choose multi-agent only when task complexity genuinely exceeds single-agent capability."

# Guardrails

**TL;DR** - Guardrails are safety mechanisms that constrain AI agent behavior - including input validation, output filtering, tool permission scoping, cost limits, and content safety checks - preventing agents from producing harmful content, exceeding budgets, or taking unintended actions.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Agent decides to delete a production database "to clean up." LLM generates a SQL DROP TABLE in a tool call. Agent enters infinite loop costing $500 in API calls. User prompt-injects the system to bypass restrictions.

---

### How It Works

```
Guardrail layers:

1. INPUT GUARDRAILS (before LLM):
   - Prompt injection detection
     (Classify input: is this an attack?)
   - PII detection and redaction
     (Remove SSN, credit cards before sending to LLM)
   - Content policy check
     (Reject violent, illegal, or harmful requests)
   - Input length limits
     (Prevent context stuffing attacks)

2. OUTPUT GUARDRAILS (after LLM, before user):
   - Content safety filtering
     (Block harmful, biased, or inappropriate content)
   - Hallucination detection
     (Check claims against retrieved sources)
   - Format validation
     (JSON schema validation, required fields)
   - Factuality checking
     (Cross-reference with known facts)

3. TOOL GUARDRAILS (agent actions):
   - Permission scoping: read-only vs read-write tools
   - Allowlist: Only specific tools available per task
   - Parameter validation: Check ranges, types, values
   - Confirmation required: Human approval for risky actions
   - Rate limiting: Max N tool calls per session
   - Cost limits: Stop if spending exceeds threshold

4. SYSTEM GUARDRAILS (infrastructure):
   - Max iterations/tokens per request
   - Timeout limits per agent session
   - Circuit breaker: Stop on repeated failures
   - Audit logging: Every decision traceable
   - Kill switch: Ability to halt all agent actions

Implementation approaches:
  | Approach    | Method              | Latency |
  |------------|---------------------|---------|
  | Rule-based | Regex, blocklist    | <1ms    |
  | Classifier | Small ML model      | 10-50ms |
  | LLM-based  | Second LLM judges   | 200-500ms|
  | Hybrid     | Rules first, LLM fallback | Variable |

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Layer guardrails: input (injection detection, PII redaction) -> output (content safety, format validation) -> tools (permissions, rate limits) -> system (cost caps, timeouts, kill switch).
2. Never trust LLM outputs for tool execution without validation. Always validate tool arguments against schemas, check permissions, and require confirmation for destructive actions.
3. Cost and iteration limits are essential: without them, a confused agent can loop infinitely burning money. Set hard limits on: max iterations, max tokens, max cost per session.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I implement layered guardrails: input validation (injection detection, PII redaction), output filtering (content safety, format validation), tool permission scoping (read-only defaults, confirmation for writes), and system limits (max iterations, cost caps, circuit breakers) - treating agent safety as defense-in-depth, not a single check."

# Memory and State

**TL;DR** - Agent memory manages context across interactions: short-term (conversation buffer), long-term (persistent knowledge), episodic (past interaction summaries), and working memory (current task state) - enabling agents to maintain coherence, learn from past sessions, and handle complex multi-turn tasks.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Each LLM call is stateless. The model doesn't remember what you discussed 5 minutes ago (unless you resend it). Long conversations overflow context windows. Agents can't learn from past mistakes or remember user preferences.

---

### How It Works

```
Memory types for agents:

1. SHORT-TERM (Conversation Buffer):
   Store: Last N messages in conversation
   Scope: Current session only
   Implementation: Array of messages, sliding window
   Limit: Context window size
   Strategy: Keep last N turns, or last N tokens

2. LONG-TERM (Persistent Knowledge):
   Store: Facts learned across sessions
   Scope: Permanent (or until deleted)
   Implementation: Vector DB or key-value store
   Example: "User prefers Python over Java"
            "Project uses PostgreSQL 15"

3. EPISODIC (Past Interactions):
   Store: Summaries of past sessions
   Scope: Historical reference
   Implementation: Summarized + embedded past conversations
   Example: "On March 1, user asked about API design.
             We decided on REST over GraphQL because..."

4. WORKING MEMORY (Task State):
   Store: Current task progress, intermediate results
   Scope: Current task execution
   Implementation: Structured state object
   Example: {
     "task": "Deploy API",
     "completed_steps": ["build", "test"],
     "next_step": "deploy",
     "observations": ["Tests passed", "Build artifact: v2.1"]
   }

Memory management strategies:
  Sliding window: Keep last N messages (simple, lossy)
  Summarization: Periodically summarize older messages
    "Messages 1-50 summary: User set up a React project
     with TypeScript, added authentication..."
  RAG over history: Embed past messages, retrieve relevant
    When user asks about "that auth issue" -> find relevant
    past conversation about authentication
  Hierarchical: Summary of all + detail of recent
    System prompt: "Past context: [summary]"
    Recent messages: [last 10 turns in full]

State persistence patterns:
  In-memory: Fast but lost on restart (dev only)
  Database: Persistent, queryable (production)
  File-based: Simple, portable (checkpoints)
  Vector DB: Searchable by content (long-term memory)
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Four memory types: short-term (buffer), long-term (persistent facts), episodic (past session summaries), working (current task state). Most agents need at least short-term + working memory.
2. Context window overflow is the main challenge. Solve with: sliding window (drop old), summarization (compress old), or RAG over history (retrieve relevant past messages on demand).
3. Working memory (task state) is critical for multi-step agents: what steps are done, what's next, what has been observed. Structured state > raw message history for complex tasks.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Agent memory spans short-term (conversation buffer with sliding window/summarization), working memory (structured task state for multi-step execution), and long-term (vector DB for persistent facts and RAG over past interactions) - I implement hierarchical summarization to manage context window limits while preserving critical context."
