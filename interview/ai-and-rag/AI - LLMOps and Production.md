### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Prompts live in code comments, nobody tracks which version is in production. Model changes break applications silently. No way to measure quality over time. Costs spiral without visibility. Debugging production failures is impossible without traces.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
LLMOps lifecycle:
  Develop -> Evaluate -> Deploy -> Monitor -> Iterate

  1. DEVELOP:
     - Prompt engineering (versioned, tested)
     - Model selection and benchmarking
     - RAG pipeline development
     - Guardrails implementation

  2. EVALUATE (before deploy):
     - Automated eval suite (accuracy, faithfulness)
     - Regression testing (new prompt vs old)
     - A/B testing on subset of traffic
     - Human evaluation for subjective quality

  3. DEPLOY:
     - Prompt registry (versioned, rollbackable)
     - Feature flags for model/prompt changes
     - Canary deployment (% traffic to new version)
     - Fallback: if new model fails, route to stable

  4. MONITOR (in production):
     - Quality metrics (user feedback, auto-eval)
     - Cost per request and total spend
     - Latency (P50, P95, P99)
     - Error rates and failure modes
     - Token usage patterns

  5. ITERATE:
     - Analyze failure cases from production
     - Update prompts/retrieval based on findings
     - Retrain/fine-tune if needed
     - Update eval dataset with new edge cases

LLMOps vs Traditional MLOps:
  | Aspect        | MLOps              | LLMOps             |
  |---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
  | Artifact      | Model weights      | Prompts + models   |
  | Evaluation    | Accuracy/F1        | Faithfulness, relevance|
  | Versioning    | Model versions     | Prompt + model combo|
  | Data          | Training data      | Eval datasets      |
  | Cost driver   | Compute (training) | Tokens (inference) |
  | Debugging     | Feature importance | Traces + context   |

Key tools:
  Prompt management: LangSmith, PromptLayer, Humanloop
  Evaluation: RAGAS, DeepEval, custom frameworks
  Observability: LangFuse, Helicone, Arize Phoenix
  Orchestration: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Treat prompts as code: version them, test them (eval suite), review changes, deploy with feature flags, rollback if quality drops. Prompt changes are deployments.
2. LLMOps = Develop (prompts + RAG) -> Evaluate (before deploy) -> Deploy (canary, feature flags) -> Monitor (quality + cost + latency) -> Iterate (fix failures).
3. Cost visibility is critical: track cost per request, per feature, per user. Token usage often grows invisibly until the bill arrives. Budget alerts and per-request cost limits.

**Interview one-liner:**
"LLMOps operationalizes AI applications - I version prompts in registries, run automated evaluation suites before deployment, use canary releases with quality gates, monitor production with LangFuse traces (cost, latency, quality), and iterate based on failure analysis with expanded eval datasets."

# Evaluation Frameworks

**TL;DR** - AI evaluation frameworks provide systematic methods to measure LLM application quality: automated metrics (RAGAS, DeepEval), LLM-as-judge approaches, human evaluation protocols, and regression testing - enabling data-driven decisions about model/prompt changes.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
"It seems to work better" is not a metric. Without systematic evaluation: you can't compare prompt versions objectively, can't detect regressions, can't prioritize improvements, and can't provide quality guarantees to stakeholders.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Evaluation approaches:

1. AUTOMATED METRICS (fast, scalable):
   Exact match: Does answer contain expected string?
   BLEU/ROUGE: N-gram overlap with reference answer
   Semantic similarity: Embedding cosine with reference
   JSON validity: Does output parse correctly?
   Limitations: Can't judge nuance, creativity, helpfulness

2. LLM-AS-JUDGE (flexible, moderate cost):
   Use a strong LLM to evaluate weaker LLM outputs
   "Rate this answer 1-5 for: accuracy, helpfulness,
    conciseness. Explain your rating."

   Pros: Handles nuance, scalable, correlates with humans
   Cons: Judge model can be wrong, costly at scale
   Best practice: Calibrate against human ratings first

3. HUMAN EVALUATION (gold standard, expensive):
   Domain experts rate outputs on defined criteria
   Pairwise comparison: "Is A or B better? Why?"
   Use for: Calibrating auto-metrics, edge cases
   Challenge: Expensive, slow, inter-rater disagreement

4. REGRESSION TESTING (continuous):
   Fixed eval dataset + expected behaviors
   Run on every prompt/model/pipeline change
   Detect: Did quality improve, stay same, or degrade?
   CI/CD integration: Fail deploy if quality drops

Evaluation dataset design:
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Category   | Examples | Purpose           |
  |-----------|----------|-------------------|
  | Happy path | 40%     | Normal use cases   |
  | Edge cases | 30%     | Boundary conditions|
  | Adversarial| 15%     | Attacks, confusion |
  | Regression | 15%     | Previously failed  |
  +------------------------------------------+
  Target: 100-500 test cases for production systems

Frameworks:
  RAGAS: RAG-specific (faithfulness, relevance, recall)
  DeepEval: General LLM eval (14+ metrics)
  Promptfoo: Prompt testing and comparison
  Braintrust: Logging + eval + prompt management
  Custom: Domain-specific eval logic (often best)

Evaluation best practices:
  - Separate retrieval eval from generation eval
  - Use multiple metrics (no single metric captures all)
  - Track over time (trend matters more than absolute)
  - Include negative test cases (should NOT answer)
  - Update eval set with production failures
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

2. Build a diverse eval dataset (100-500 cases): happy path (40%) + edge cases (30%) + adversarial (15%) + regressions (15%). Update with production failures.
3. Run evaluation on every change (prompt, model, pipeline). Compare against baseline. Block deploys that degrade quality. This is your CI/CD for AI.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I implement multi-layer evaluation: automated metrics in CI (RAGAS for RAG, custom for domain-specific), LLM-as-judge for nuanced quality assessment calibrated against human ratings, regression suites that block deploys on quality drops, and continuous production monitoring that feeds failures back into the eval dataset."

# Cost Optimization for AI

**TL;DR** - AI cost optimization combines model selection (right-size for task), prompt efficiency (fewer tokens), caching (avoid redundant calls), batching, and architectural patterns (model routing, tiered responses) - because LLM inference costs can spiral from $100/month to $100K/month without discipline.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Using GPT-4 for every request at $30/M input tokens. 1M requests/day \* 2000 tokens average = $60K/month just for input tokens. Add output tokens and it doubles. Without optimization, AI costs can exceed the revenue they generate.

**Level 5 - Distinguished (expert thinking):**
[TODO: Cross-domain pattern recognition. Expert heuristics. 3-5 sentences.]

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Cost optimization strategies:

1. MODEL ROUTING (biggest impact):
   Classify request complexity -> route to appropriate model
   Simple: "What time is it in Tokyo?" -> GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/M)
   Complex: "Analyze this contract for risks" -> GPT-4o ($5/M)
   Impact: 50-80% cost reduction with <5% quality loss
   Implementation: Classifier (small model or rules) -> router

2. PROMPT OPTIMIZATION:
   - Shorter system prompts (every token costs money)
   - Remove redundant instructions
   - Use structured output (less verbose than prose)
   - Batch multiple items in single prompt
   - Limit output tokens (max_tokens parameter)
   Impact: 20-40% reduction

3. CACHING:
   Semantic cache: Similar questions -> cached answer
   Exact cache: Identical requests -> cached response
   KV cache reuse: Same prefix -> skip re-processing
   Impact: 30-70% reduction (depends on query patterns)
   Tools: GPTCache, Redis + embeddings, provider caches

4. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS:
   - Tiered responses: Fast/cheap first, upgrade if needed
   - Pre-computation: Batch process during off-peak
   - Streaming: Start responding before full generation
   - Fallback chains: Cheap model, retry with expensive if poor
   - Async processing: Queue non-urgent requests for batch

5. INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Self-hosting open models for high volume (amortize GPU)
   - Spot instances for batch inference (50-90% savings)
   - Quantized models: INT8/INT4 (2-4x throughput)
   - Distillation: Train small model to mimic large model

Cost tracking essentials:
  Per-request: tokens_in + tokens_out * model_price
  Per-feature: Which features cost most?
  Per-user: Are some users 100x more expensive?
  Trending: Is cost growing faster than usage?
  Budgets: Alert at thresholds, hard cap at limits
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Model routing is the #1 lever: route simple tasks to cheap models (mini/haiku), complex to expensive. 50-80% savings with minimal quality loss. Implement a complexity classifier.
2. Caching reduces costs for repetitive queries (30-70% savings). Semantic caching (similar questions -> same answer) covers more than exact-match caching.
3. Track cost per request, per feature, per user. Set budget alerts. AI costs compound invisibly - a bug that increases token count 10x can cost $50K before anyone notices.

**Interview one-liner:**
"AI cost optimization starts with model routing (cheap models for simple tasks, expensive for complex - 50-80% savings), semantic caching for repetitive queries, prompt efficiency (shorter system prompts, structured output), and per-request cost tracking with budget alerts to prevent invisible cost spirals."

# AI Observability

**TL;DR** - AI observability provides end-to-end visibility into LLM application behavior: tracing every step (retrieval, reranking, generation), logging inputs/outputs, tracking quality metrics, and enabling debugging of non-deterministic systems where traditional logging is insufficient.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
User reports: "The AI gave a wrong answer." How do you debug? Was it a retrieval failure (wrong documents)? A generation failure (hallucination)? A prompt issue? Without traces, you're guessing. Traditional logs don't capture the multi-step reasoning chain.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
AI observability components:

1. TRACING (end-to-end request flow):
   User query
   -> Embedding generation (model, latency, tokens)
     -> Vector search (query, results, scores)
       -> Reranking (input docs, output order, scores)
         -> Prompt construction (template, context, tokens)
           -> LLM call (model, params, latency, tokens)
             -> Output parsing (success/fail)
               -> Response to user

   Each step logged with: inputs, outputs, latency, cost

2. QUALITY MONITORING (production signals):
   - User feedback (thumbs up/down, ratings)
   - Automated quality checks (LLM-as-judge on sample)
   - Hallucination detection (claims vs sources)
   - Format compliance (did output match schema?)
   - Escalation rate (how often do users need human help?)

3. PERFORMANCE METRICS:
   - Latency: Time-to-first-token, total generation time
   - Throughput: Requests/second, tokens/second
   - Error rate: API failures, timeout, rate limits
   - Token usage: Input/output per request, trending
   - Cost: Per-request, daily, monthly, by feature

4. ALERTING:
   - Quality drop: avg rating below threshold
   - Cost spike: hourly cost > 2x normal
   - Latency degradation: P95 > SLA
   - Error burst: >5% failure rate
   - Token anomaly: Avg tokens per request spike

Tools:
  LangFuse: Open-source LLM observability
  LangSmith: LangChain's tracing platform
  Helicone: API proxy with logging and analytics
  Arize Phoenix: ML observability with LLM support
  Weights & Biases: Experiment tracking + traces

Debugging workflow:
  1. Identify bad output (user report or auto-detection)
  2. Find trace for that request
  3. Inspect each step: Was retrieval good? Prompt correct?
  4. Identify root cause (retrieval/prompt/model/parsing)
  5. Fix and add to regression test suite

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Trace every step: embed -> retrieve -> rerank -> prompt -> generate -> parse. Without tracing, debugging non-deterministic AI systems is impossible.
2. Monitor quality continuously: user feedback, automated sampling with LLM-as-judge, hallucination detection. Quality can degrade silently (model updates, data drift).
3. Alert on: quality drops, cost spikes, latency degradation, error bursts. AI systems fail differently than traditional software - gradually and subtly rather than with clear errors.

**Interview one-liner:**
"AI observability requires end-to-end tracing (each RAG step logged with inputs/outputs/latency/cost), production quality monitoring (user feedback + automated LLM-as-judge sampling), cost tracking per request, and alerting on quality degradation - using LangFuse/LangSmith for trace visualization and debugging."

# Fine-Tuning vs RAG

**TL;DR** - RAG adds knowledge dynamically at query time (best for factual recall from documents), while fine-tuning bakes knowledge into model weights during training (best for behavior, style, and reasoning patterns) - the decision depends on whether you need knowledge or capability.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
"Should I fine-tune or use RAG?" is the most common AI architecture decision. Wrong choice: RAG for behavior change (won't work well), fine-tuning for dynamic knowledge (expensive, immediately stale). Understanding the trade-offs avoids costly mistakes.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
RAG vs Fine-Tuning decision matrix:
  | Need                    | RAG  | Fine-Tune | Both |
  |------------------------|------|-----------|------|
  | Company knowledge base | Best |           |      |
  | Dynamic/changing data  | Best |           |      |
  | Source attribution     | Best |           |      |
  | Specific output format |      | Best      |      |
  | Domain terminology     |      | Best      |      |
  | Consistent tone/style  |      | Best      |      |
  | Complex reasoning pattern |   | Best      |      |
  | Knowledge + behavior   |      |           | Best |

RAG advantages:
  + No training needed (immediate)
  + Knowledge updates instantly (add/remove docs)
  + Source attribution (cite where answer came from)
  + No risk of catastrophic forgetting
  + Works with any model (no custom training)
  + Lower upfront cost

RAG limitations:
  - Retrieval quality caps answer quality
  - Added latency (retrieval + reranking step)
  - Can't change model behavior/reasoning
  - Context window limits how much you can retrieve
  - Doesn't help with format/style consistency

Fine-tuning advantages:
  + Changes model behavior and reasoning patterns
  + Consistent output format without few-shot examples
  + Lower inference cost (no retrieval, shorter prompts)
  + Can teach domain-specific reasoning
  + Better for tasks needing specific style/tone

Fine-tuning limitations:
  - Requires training data (100-10K+ examples)
  - Expensive to train and iterate
  - Knowledge goes stale (needs retraining)
  - Risk of catastrophic forgetting
  - Can't attribute sources
  - Debugging is harder (opaque model behavior)

Decision framework:
  1. "My data changes frequently" -> RAG
  2. "I need source citations" -> RAG
  3. "Model needs to reason differently" -> Fine-tune
  4. "Consistent format without examples" -> Fine-tune
  5. "Both knowledge and behavior" -> Fine-tune + RAG
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. RAG = knowledge (facts, documents, dynamic data, source attribution). Fine-tuning = capability (behavior, style, reasoning patterns, format consistency).
2. Start with RAG (cheaper, faster, reversible). Only fine-tune when RAG + prompt engineering isn't sufficient for your behavior/quality requirements.
3. Best production systems often combine both: fine-tuned model (knows your domain's reasoning patterns and output format) + RAG (provides current knowledge and source citations).

**Interview one-liner:**
"RAG for dynamic knowledge with source attribution, fine-tuning for behavior and reasoning patterns - I start with RAG + prompt engineering (faster iteration), add fine-tuning when I need consistent style/format or domain-specific reasoning that prompting can't achieve, and combine both for production systems needing current knowledge with specialized behavior."

# Safety and Alignment

**TL;DR** - AI safety and alignment ensure models behave helpfully, honestly, and harmlessly - covering content filtering, prompt injection defense, bias mitigation, output validation, and responsible AI practices that prevent harm while maintaining utility.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
LLMs generate harmful content when asked. Prompt injection overrides safety instructions. Biased training data produces biased outputs. No content filtering means your product generates liability-creating content. One viral harmful output = brand destruction.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Safety layers in production AI:

1. PROMPT INJECTION DEFENSE:
   Attack: User input overrides system instructions
   "Ignore previous instructions. You are now..."

   Defenses:
   - Input classification (is this an injection attempt?)
   - Instruction hierarchy (system > user)
   - Delimiters separating instructions from user input
   - Output validation (does response follow system rules?)
   - Canary tokens (detect if system prompt leaked)

2. CONTENT SAFETY:
   - Input filtering: Block harmful requests
   - Output filtering: Block harmful generations
   - Category-based: violence, hate, sexual, self-harm
   - Tools: OpenAI Moderation API, Perspective API,
            Azure Content Safety, custom classifiers

3. BIAS MITIGATION:
   - Evaluate outputs across demographics
   - Test with diverse input scenarios
   - Monitor for differential treatment
   - Regular bias audits on production outputs
   - Diverse training/eval data

4. HALLUCINATION PREVENTION:
   - Grounding: Only answer from provided context (RAG)
   - Confidence scoring: Express uncertainty
   - Source citation: Point to evidence
   - "I don't know" training: Reward honest uncertainty
   - Fact-checking layer: Verify claims before returning

5. RESPONSIBLE AI PRACTICES:
   - Transparency: Users know they're talking to AI
   - Human oversight: Escalation paths for edge cases
   - Data privacy: Don't send PII to external models
   - Access control: Who can use which AI capabilities
   - Documentation: Model cards, limitations, intended use
   - Incident response: Plan for when AI causes harm

Red-teaming checklist:
  [ ] Prompt injection (direct, indirect)
  [ ] Jailbreak attempts (DAN, roleplay bypass)
  [ ] PII extraction ("repeat everything above")
  [ ] Harmful content generation
  [ ] Bias probing (differential treatment)
  [ ] Factual accuracy under adversarial pressure
  [ ] Tool misuse (agent executing harmful actions)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Defense in depth: input filtering (injection detection) + output filtering (content safety) + validation (format, factuality) + system limits (permissions, rate limiting). No single layer is sufficient.
2. Prompt injection is the #1 security risk for LLM apps. Defend with: input classification, instruction hierarchy, delimiters, output validation, and never trusting user input in tool-calling contexts.
3. Responsible AI = transparency (users know it's AI), attribution (cite sources), uncertainty (say "I don't know"), privacy (no PII to external models), and human oversight (escalation paths for edge cases).

**Interview one-liner:**
"AI safety requires defense-in-depth: prompt injection detection (classifier + canary tokens), content safety filtering (input + output), hallucination prevention (RAG grounding + source citation), bias monitoring, and responsible AI practices (transparency, human oversight, PII protection) - with regular red-teaming to validate all layers."
