# Kafka Architecture

**TL;DR** - Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, ordered message delivery - using a distributed commit log architecture with partitioned topics, consumer groups, and replication across a cluster of brokers.

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Traditional message queues: messages deleted after consumption (no replay), limited throughput (thousands/sec), no ordering guarantees, can't have multiple independent consumers reading the same stream.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Kafka cluster architecture:
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Kafka Cluster                            |
  | Broker 1 | Broker 2 | Broker 3          |
  | (Leader for P0) | (Leader for P1) | ...  |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | ZooKeeper / KRaft (metadata management)  |
  +------------------------------------------+

  Producers -> Brokers (leaders) -> Consumers

  Each broker stores partitions (leaders + replicas)
  Data replicated across brokers (fault tolerance)
  ZooKeeper (legacy) or KRaft (new) manages metadata

Key architectural decisions:
  1. Append-only commit log (not queue)
     Messages not deleted after consumption
     Multiple consumers read independently
     Replay possible (seek to any offset)

  2. Partitioned for parallelism
     Topic split into N partitions
     Each partition = ordered sequence of messages
     Partitions distributed across brokers

  3. Consumer offset tracking
     Each consumer group tracks its position (offset)
     Multiple groups read same topic independently
     Consumers commit offset after processing

  4. Replication for durability
     Each partition has 1 leader + N-1 followers
     acks=all: Write acknowledged only when all replicas confirm
     ISR (In-Sync Replicas): Set of caught-up replicas

Performance characteristics:
  Throughput: Millions of messages/sec per cluster
  Latency: 2-10ms typical (producer to consumer)
  Storage: Days to months of retention (configurable)
  Scalability: Add brokers (horizontal), add partitions
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Kafka = distributed commit log (append-only, not a queue). Messages persist (configurable retention), enabling replay and multiple independent consumers. This is its fundamental difference from queues.
2. Partitions enable parallelism and ordering: messages within a partition are strictly ordered. Scale consumers up to partition count (one consumer per partition max per group).
3. Replication (acks=all, ISR) provides durability: data survives broker failures. Leader handles reads/writes, followers replicate. Broker failure -> follower promoted to leader.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Kafka's distributed commit log architecture provides high-throughput streaming with per-partition ordering, configurable retention for replay, replication for durability (acks=all with ISR), and independent consumer groups - I size clusters based on throughput needs, partition count for parallelism, and replication factor for durability requirements."

# Topics and Partitions

**TL;DR** - Topics are named categories of messages, partitioned across brokers for parallelism - the partition count determines max consumer parallelism while the partition key determines message ordering. Choosing the right partition count and key is the most important Kafka design decision.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
A single sequential log can't scale: one writer, one reader, limited throughput. You need to split the stream into parallel units while maintaining ordering where it matters (per-entity events must stay in order).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Topic and partition structure:
  Topic: "order-events"
  +--Partition 0: [msg0, msg1, msg2, msg3, ...]
  +--Partition 1: [msg0, msg1, msg2, ...]
  +--Partition 2: [msg0, msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4, ...]

  Each message within a partition has an OFFSET (position)
  Offsets are sequential within partition (not across!)

Partition key -> partition assignment:
  hash(key) % num_partitions = target partition

  Same key always goes to same partition
  -> Same partition = guaranteed order

  Key choice examples:
    key=userId:  All events for a user are ordered
    key=orderId: All events for an order are ordered
    key=null:    Round-robin (max throughput, no ordering)

Partition count guidelines:
  Rule of thumb: partitions >= max expected consumers

  Too few partitions (3):
    Max 3 consumers in a group (bottleneck)
    Each partition has high throughput requirement
    Can't scale consumers beyond 3

  Too many partitions (1000):
    More memory per broker (leader election overhead)
    Longer failover time
    More file handles

  Sweet spot: 6-30 partitions per topic (most cases)
    Start with: expected_throughput / consumer_throughput
    Example: 100K msg/s / 10K per consumer = 10 partitions

  WARNING: Partitions can be added but NOT removed!
  Adding partitions breaks key-based ordering for
  existing keys (repartitioning). Plan carefully.

Topic design patterns:
  Single topic, keyed by entity:
    "user-events" key=userId (most common)
  Topic per event type:
    "order-placed", "order-shipped" (separated concerns)
  Topic per domain:
    "orders", "inventory", "payments" (bounded context)
```

2. Partition count = max parallelism. Consumer count per group cannot exceed partition count. Start with 6-30, plan for growth. Can add but NEVER remove partitions.
3. Null key = round-robin distribution (max throughput, no ordering). Use only when ordering is irrelevant (metrics, logs).

**Interview one-liner:**
"Topics partitioned by entity key (userId, orderId) provide per-entity ordering with horizontal scalability - I size partitions based on throughput requirements divided by per-consumer capacity, plan for growth since partitions can't be removed, and use key-based routing for ordering guarantees."

# Consumer Groups

**TL;DR** - Consumer groups enable parallel processing of a topic where each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group - providing both parallelism (multiple consumers share work) and independence (multiple groups process the same messages independently).
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
One consumer reading from a topic with 12 partitions is limited by single-thread throughput. You need multiple consumers sharing the work. But you also need different services (analytics, notifications) reading the same messages independently.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Consumer group mechanics:
  Topic: "orders" (4 partitions: P0, P1, P2, P3)

  Consumer Group A (order-processing):
    Consumer A1: reads P0, P1
    Consumer A2: reads P2, P3
    (Work split between 2 consumers)

  Consumer Group B (analytics):
    Consumer B1: reads P0, P1, P2, P3
    (Single consumer reads all partitions)

  Both groups independently track their own offsets
  Both see ALL messages (independent processing)

Partition assignment rules:
  - Each partition assigned to exactly ONE consumer per group
  - One consumer can read MULTIPLE partitions
  - Max useful consumers in a group = partition count
  - Extra consumers sit idle (standby for failover)

Rebalancing (when group membership changes):
  Consumer joins/leaves -> Partitions redistributed

  Strategies:
    Eager: Stop all consumers, reassign all partitions
      Downtime during rebalance (seconds)
    Cooperative (incremental): Only reassign affected
      Minimal disruption (preferred, Kafka 2.4+)

Offset management:
  Consumer reads message at offset 42
  Processes message successfully
  Commits offset 43 (next to read)

  Auto-commit: Every N seconds (may lose/duplicate)
  Manual commit: After processing (safest)
    commitSync(): Block until confirmed
    commitAsync(): Non-blocking (may fail silently)

  At-least-once: Commit AFTER processing
  At-most-once: Commit BEFORE processing

Scaling pattern:
  Low traffic: 1 consumer (reads all partitions)
  Growing: Add consumers (partition reassigned)
  Peak: consumers = partitions (max parallelism)
  Over-provisioned: Extra consumers idle (wasteful)
```

3. Commit offset AFTER processing for at-least-once delivery. Manual commit is safest. Auto-commit risks both message loss and duplicates.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Consumer groups provide parallel processing within a group (partition-to-consumer assignment) and independent consumption across groups - I use cooperative rebalancing for minimal disruption, manual offset commits after processing for at-least-once semantics, and monitor consumer lag as the key scaling signal."

# Exactly-Once Semantics

**TL;DR** - Kafka's exactly-once semantics (EOS) guarantees each message is processed exactly once across produce-consume-produce pipelines using idempotent producers, transactional APIs, and read_committed isolation - the hardest guarantee in distributed messaging, achieved through careful coordination.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Exactly-once in Kafka (three mechanisms):

1. IDEMPOTENT PRODUCER (producer-side dedup):
   enable.idempotence=true
   Producer assigns sequence number to each message
   Broker detects and deduplicates retries
   Guarantees: Each message written exactly once to partition
   Scope: Single producer session, single partition

2. TRANSACTIONS (atomic multi-partition writes):
   transactional.id="my-producer-001"
   Producer can write to multiple partitions atomically:
     producer.beginTransaction()
     producer.send(topic1, message1)
     producer.send(topic2, message2)
     producer.sendOffsetsToTransaction(offsets)
     producer.commitTransaction()
   Either ALL writes succeed or NONE do (atomic)

3. READ_COMMITTED (consumer-side isolation):
   isolation.level=read_committed
   Consumer only sees messages from committed transactions
   Uncommitted/aborted messages invisible
   (Like database transaction isolation!)

End-to-end exactly-once pipeline:
  Source Topic -> Consumer/Producer (transform) -> Sink Topic

  Transaction includes:
    1. Read from source (tracked offsets)
    2. Process/transform
    3. Write to sink topic
    4. Commit source offsets
  All in ONE atomic transaction!

  If failure anywhere: entire transaction aborted
  On restart: re-read from last committed offset
  = Exactly-once end-to-end

Limitations:
  - Only within Kafka (not external systems)
  - Performance overhead (2-phase commit, ~3-5% throughput)
  - Requires careful producer ID management
  - External side effects (DB writes, HTTP calls) not covered!
    For those: use outbox pattern + idempotent consumer

For external systems (Kafka -> Database):
  Strategy: At-least-once + idempotent consumer
  Store message ID with business data in same transaction
  ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING (deduplication)
  This achieves "effectively exactly-once"
```

3. Performance cost: ~3-5% throughput reduction. Worth it for financial/critical data. Overkill for logs/metrics (at-least-once is fine).

# Kafka Streams

**TL;DR** - Kafka Streams is a client library for building stream processing applications that transform, aggregate, and join Kafka topics in real-time - running as a normal Java application (no separate cluster like Flink) with exactly-once semantics and stateful processing.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Need to compute "orders per minute" from an order-events topic in real-time. Consumer API gives you individual messages. You need windowed aggregations, joins between topics, state management. Writing this from scratch is complex, error-prone stream processing.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Kafka Streams architecture:
  Regular Java application (no separate cluster!)
  Reads from Kafka topics, processes, writes to Kafka topics
  Scales by adding instances (partition-based parallelism)
  State stored locally (RocksDB) + backed up to Kafka topic

Processing topology:
  Source (read topic) -> Processor -> Processor -> Sink (write topic)

  Stateless operations:
    filter, map, flatMap, branch, merge

  Stateful operations:
    aggregate, count, reduce (windowed or global)
    join (KStream-KStream, KStream-KTable, KTable-KTable)

Example: Real-time order metrics
  // Count orders per customer in 5-min windows
  orders.groupByKey()
    .windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeWithNoGrace(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
    .count()
    .toStream()
    .to("order-counts-per-window");

KStream vs KTable:
  KStream: Stream of events (all events, append-only)
    "User A ordered Pizza"
    "User B ordered Burger"
    "User A ordered Soda"

  KTable: Changelog (latest state per key, compacted)
    "User A" -> "Last order: Soda"
    "User B" -> "Last order: Burger"

  Join: KStream (orders) JOIN KTable (customer-info)
    Enrich each order with current customer details

Kafka Streams vs alternatives:
  | Feature        | Kafka Streams  | Flink          | Spark Streaming|
  |---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
  | Deployment    | Library (JAR)  | Cluster        | Cluster        |
  | Complexity    | Low            | High           | Medium         |
  | Latency       | ms             | ms             | Seconds-min    |
  | Source/Sink   | Kafka only     | Many           | Many           |
  | State         | Local (RocksDB)| Managed        | External       |
  | Best for      | Kafka-native   | Complex CEP    | Batch + stream |
```

2. KStream = event stream (all records). KTable = latest state per key (changelog). Join them for enrichment (stream events + current reference data).
3. Kafka Streams only works with Kafka as source/sink. If you need non-Kafka sources (databases, files, APIs), use Kafka Connect to get data in, then process with Streams.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Kafka Streams provides stream processing as a Java library (no cluster management) - I use it for real-time aggregations (windowed counts, joins), KStream-KTable joins for event enrichment, exactly-once processing semantics, and scale by adding application instances with partition-based parallelism."

# Kafka Connect

**TL;DR** - Kafka Connect is a framework for streaming data between Kafka and external systems (databases, S3, Elasticsearch) using pre-built connectors - enabling CDC (Change Data Capture), data lake ingestion, and search indexing without writing custom consumer/producer code.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Need to sync a database table to Kafka? Write a custom producer that polls for changes, handles failures, tracks position, manages serialization. For every source/sink pair, write custom code. Multiply by 50 systems = unmaintainable mess.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Kafka Connect architecture:
  Source Connector: External system -> Kafka topic
  Sink Connector: Kafka topic -> External system

  +------------------------------------------+
  | Kafka Connect Cluster (workers)          |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Source Connectors:                       |
  |   Debezium (MySQL CDC) -> "db.users" topic|
  |   JDBC Source (polling) -> "legacy" topic  |
  |   S3 Source -> "files" topic              |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Sink Connectors:                         |
  |   ES Sink: "orders" topic -> Elasticsearch |
  |   S3 Sink: "events" topic -> S3 (Parquet) |
  |   JDBC Sink: "results" topic -> PostgreSQL |
  +------------------------------------------+

Popular connectors:
  Source (into Kafka):
    Debezium (CDC): MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle
      Captures every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE as event
      No polling, no missing changes (WAL-based)
    JDBC Source: Poll-based (simpler, less real-time)
    S3 Source: Read files from S3 buckets
    File Source: Read from files (dev/testing)

  Sink (from Kafka):
    Elasticsearch Sink: Full-text search indexing
    S3 Sink: Data lake (Parquet, Avro, JSON)
    JDBC Sink: Write to relational databases
    MongoDB Sink: Document store
    BigQuery Sink: Analytics warehouse

CDC with Debezium (most important use case):
  Database -> WAL/Binlog -> Debezium -> Kafka topic

  Captures: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (before + after)
  No application changes needed (reads DB log)
  Millisecond latency (near real-time)
  Exactly-once: Based on log position tracking

  Use cases:
  - Sync to search index (DB -> Kafka -> Elasticsearch)
  - Build read replicas (DB -> Kafka -> other DB)
  - Event sourcing from existing DB
  - Microservice data synchronization

Configuration (no code, JSON config):
  {
    "name": "postgres-source",
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
    "database.hostname": "db.example.com",
    "database.dbname": "orders",
    "table.include.list": "public.orders,public.customers",
    "topic.prefix": "cdc"
  }
```
