# Dead Letter Queues

**TL;DR** - Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) capture messages that fail processing after exhausting retries - isolating poison messages from blocking the main queue, enabling investigation and reprocessing, and preventing a single bad message from stopping an entire processing pipeline.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
A malformed message enters the queue. Consumer tries to process it, fails, message retries. Fails again. Retries forever. The bad message blocks all subsequent messages (head-of-line blocking). The entire queue is stuck because of one poison message.

---

### How It Works

```
DLQ flow:
  Main Queue -> Consumer tries processing
    Attempt 1: Fails (exception, timeout, validation)
    Attempt 2: Fails again
    Attempt 3: Fails again (max retries exhausted)
    -> Message moved to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

  Main queue continues processing next messages!
  DLQ holds failed messages for investigation.

DLQ configuration (SQS example):
  Main Queue: maxReceiveCount = 3
  DLQ: Associated dead letter queue
  After 3 failed attempts -> auto-move to DLQ

DLQ configuration (RabbitMQ):
  Queue args: x-dead-letter-exchange = "dlx"
              x-dead-letter-routing-key = "dlq"
  Messages rejected/expired/queue-full -> routed to DLX

What belongs in DLQ:
  - Poison messages (malformed, unparseable)
  - Business validation failures (invalid data)
  - Downstream dependency permanent failures
  - Messages that exceed size/complexity limits
  - Expired messages (TTL exceeded)

DLQ operations:
  MONITOR: Alert when DLQ depth > 0 (something's wrong)
  INVESTIGATE: Read DLQ messages, identify root cause
  FIX: Fix consumer bug or data issue
  REPLAY: Move messages back to main queue for reprocessing
  PURGE: Delete after investigation (if truly invalid)

Best practices:
  - ALWAYS configure a DLQ (never let messages retry forever)
  - Set appropriate max retry count (3-5 typical)
  - Add exponential backoff between retries
  - Include original error reason in DLQ metadata
  - Monitor DLQ depth with alerting (PagerDuty)
  - Build tooling to replay DLQ messages back to main queue
  - Retain DLQ messages long enough for investigation (14 days)
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. DLQ isolates poison messages: after N failures, move to DLQ so main queue keeps flowing. Without DLQ, one bad message blocks everything (head-of-line blocking).
2. Always monitor DLQ depth. DLQ messages > 0 = something is wrong (bug, schema change, dependency down). Alert immediately and investigate.
3. Build replay capability: after fixing the bug, replay DLQ messages back to main queue for reprocessing. Don't just delete them - they represent unfinished work.

**Interview one-liner:**
"DLQs prevent poison messages from blocking processing pipelines - I configure max 3-5 retries with exponential backoff before dead-lettering, alert on DLQ depth > 0, include failure metadata for root cause analysis, and build replay tooling for reprocessing after fixes."

# Idempotency

**TL;DR** - Idempotency means processing the same message multiple times produces the same result as processing it once - essential for at-least-once messaging where duplicate delivery is guaranteed to happen, requiring consumers to detect and handle repeated messages safely.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
At-least-once delivery means duplicates WILL arrive. Without idempotency: payment charged twice, email sent twice, inventory decremented twice, order created twice. Every duplicate message causes incorrect state.

---

### How It Works

```
Idempotent vs Non-idempotent operations:
  IDEMPOTENT (safe to repeat):
    SET balance = 100 (same result every time)
    PUT /users/123 {name: "Alice"} (upsert)
    DELETE /items/456 (already deleted = no-op)

  NOT IDEMPOTENT (dangerous to repeat):
    balance += 10 (adds 10 each time!)
    POST /orders (creates new order each time!)
    INSERT INTO ... (creates duplicate rows!)

Making operations idempotent:

1. DEDUPLICATION KEY (most common):
   Each message has unique ID (messageId, eventId)
   Before processing: "Have I seen this ID?"

   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     SELECT 1 FROM processed_messages
       WHERE message_id = 'msg-123';
     -- If exists: SKIP (already processed)
     -- If not: process + INSERT into processed_messages
   COMMIT;

2. NATURAL IDEMPOTENCY (design for it):
   Instead of: "Add $10 to account"
   Use: "Set account balance to $110 (from $100)"
        (includes expected before-state)

   Or: "Process payment for order-123"
       + ON CONFLICT (order_id) DO NOTHING

3. IDEMPOTENCY KEY (client-provided):
   Client generates unique key per operation
   Server stores key with result
   Retry with same key -> return cached result
   (Stripe, payment processors use this pattern)

4. VERSION/TIMESTAMP BASED:
   "Update user WHERE version = 5"
   If version already 6: update is no-op (stale)
   Optimistic locking prevents duplicate updates

Implementation patterns:
  Database: Unique constraint on business key
    INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
  Redis: SETNX on message_id with TTL
    If key exists -> duplicate (skip)
  Both: Combine - Redis for fast check, DB for durable record

Deduplication window:
  How long to remember processed IDs?
  Too short: Late duplicates not caught
  Too long: Storage grows forever
  Typical: 7 days (match max retry window)
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Every message consumer MUST be idempotent when using at-least-once delivery (which is standard). Duplicates are not a possibility - they're a certainty in production.
2. Simplest pattern: store message_id in same transaction as business logic. Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING or check-then-process with unique constraint.
3. Design operations to be naturally idempotent: "set X to Y" (repeatable) instead of "add Z to X" (accumulates). Include expected-state or version to detect stale operations.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Idempotency is non-negotiable for at-least-once consumers - I use deduplication keys stored atomically with business logic (INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING), design naturally idempotent operations (absolute state over relative), and implement idempotency keys for client-facing APIs (Stripe pattern) with appropriate TTL-based dedup windows."

# Saga Pattern

**TL;DR** - The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions across microservices using a sequence of local transactions with compensating actions for rollback - replacing traditional two-phase commit (2PC) which doesn't scale, with eventual consistency and explicit failure handling.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Order processing spans: Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service, Shipping Service. Each has its own database. You can't use a single database transaction across services. If Payment succeeds but Inventory fails, how do you undo the payment?

---

### How It Works

```
Saga: Sequence of local transactions + compensations

  Order Saga (happy path):
    T1: Create Order (status=PENDING)
    T2: Reserve Inventory
    T3: Charge Payment
    T4: Confirm Order (status=CONFIRMED)
    T5: Schedule Shipping

  Order Saga (failure at T3):
    T1: Create Order -> success
    T2: Reserve Inventory -> success
    T3: Charge Payment -> FAILS!
    C2: Release Inventory (compensate T2)
    C1: Cancel Order (compensate T1)

  Each step has a compensation (undo action):
    T1 <-> C1: Create/Cancel Order
    T2 <-> C2: Reserve/Release Inventory
    T3 <-> C3: Charge/Refund Payment

Saga orchestration approaches:

1. CHOREOGRAPHY (event-driven, no coordinator):
   Order Service publishes "OrderCreated"
   -> Inventory Service reacts: reserves, publishes "InventoryReserved"
   -> Payment Service reacts: charges, publishes "PaymentCharged"
   -> Order Service reacts: confirms order

   Pros: Simple, loosely coupled, no single point of failure
   Cons: Hard to track overall state, complex flow logic
   Use when: Simple sagas (3-4 steps), loose coupling priority

2. ORCHESTRATION (central coordinator):
   Saga Orchestrator sends commands to each service:
     -> "Reserve Inventory" -> waits for response
     -> "Charge Payment" -> waits for response
     -> "Confirm Order" -> done
   On failure: Orchestrator sends compensation commands

   Pros: Clear flow, easy to track state, centralized logic
   Cons: Orchestrator is single point (must be resilient)
   Use when: Complex sagas (5+ steps), need visibility

Saga challenges:
  - Isolation: Other transactions see intermediate states
    (Order visible as PENDING during saga execution)
  - Compensation may fail: Need retry logic for compensations
  - Observability: Track saga state across services
  - Testing: Complex failure scenarios to test
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Saga = sequence of local transactions, each with a compensating action (undo). If step N fails, execute compensations for steps N-1 through 1. Replaces distributed transactions.
2. Choreography (events, decentralized) for simple sagas. Orchestration (coordinator, centralized) for complex sagas. Orchestration is easier to reason about and debug.
3. Sagas provide eventual consistency, not immediate. Intermediate states are visible (order in PENDING during processing). Design for this: show appropriate status to users, handle race conditions.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Sagas manage distributed transactions via local transactions with compensating actions - I use orchestration for complex flows (5+ services, clear state tracking) and choreography for simple ones, with idempotent compensations, saga state persistence, and timeout-based failure detection for each step."

# Outbox Pattern

**TL;DR** - The Outbox pattern solves the dual-write problem by atomically writing business data AND the event message to the same database transaction, then asynchronously publishing the event from the outbox table - guaranteeing consistency between database state and published events.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Service updates database (step 1), then publishes event to Kafka (step 2). If step 2 fails: database updated but event never published (inconsistency). If service crashes between steps: same problem. You can't have an atomic transaction spanning a database AND a message broker.

---

### How It Works

```
The dual-write problem:
  1. UPDATE orders SET status='confirmed'  -- succeeds
  2. kafka.publish("order-confirmed")      -- FAILS (or crash)
  Result: DB says confirmed, but no event published!
  Downstream services never know about the confirmation.

Outbox pattern solution:
  Single atomic transaction:
    BEGIN;
      UPDATE orders SET status = 'confirmed';
      INSERT INTO outbox (id, topic, key, payload, created_at)
        VALUES (uuid, 'order-events', 'order-123',
                '{"event":"confirmed",...}', now());
    COMMIT;

  Then: Separate process reads outbox -> publishes to Kafka
  After publish: Mark outbox row as published (or delete)

  Guarantee: If DB commit succeeds, event WILL be published
             (eventually). If DB commit fails, no event.

Outbox publishing approaches:

1. POLLING PUBLISHER:
   SELECT * FROM outbox WHERE published = false
     ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 100;
   For each: publish to Kafka, mark published=true

   Pros: Simple, works with any database
   Cons: Polling delay (100ms-1s), database load

2. CDC-BASED (Debezium, recommended):
   Debezium reads database WAL/binlog
   Detects INSERT into outbox table
   Automatically publishes to Kafka topic

   Pros: Real-time (ms latency), no polling, no extra load
   Cons: Requires CDC infrastructure (Debezium + Kafka Connect)

Outbox table schema:
  CREATE TABLE outbox (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(255),  -- "Order"
    aggregate_id VARCHAR(255),    -- "order-123"
    event_type VARCHAR(255),      -- "OrderConfirmed"
    topic VARCHAR(255),           -- "order-events"
    payload JSONB,                -- Full event data
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
  );

Important: Consumer must still be idempotent!
  Outbox guarantees at-least-once publishing
  (Debezium may republish on restart/failure)
  Consumer handles duplicates with dedup key = outbox.id
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Outbox solves the dual-write problem: write business data + event in ONE database transaction. Publish event asynchronously from outbox table. Guarantees consistency.
2. Debezium CDC > polling: reads database WAL in real-time, no polling delay, no extra DB load. Debezium + outbox table is the production-standard pattern.
3. Outbox provides at-least-once event publishing (may publish duplicates on failure/restart). Consumers still must be idempotent. Use outbox row ID as deduplication key.

**Interview one-liner:**
"The Outbox pattern solves dual-writes by atomically persisting business data and events in one transaction, with Debezium CDC reading the outbox table from the WAL for real-time publishing to Kafka - guaranteeing no lost events with consumers still designed for idempotent at-least-once processing."

# Event Sourcing

**TL;DR** - Event Sourcing stores state as a sequence of immutable events (facts that happened) rather than current state - enabling complete audit trails, temporal queries (state at any point in time), replay for debugging, and rebuilding read models, at the cost of increased complexity.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Database stores current state only: balance = $500. How did we get here? When was the last deposit? Was there a suspicious withdrawal at 3am? Current state tells you WHAT, not HOW or WHEN. History is lost.

---

### How It Works

```
Traditional (state-based):
  Account table: {id: 123, balance: 500, updated_at: ...}
  (History is gone. You only see current state.)

Event Sourced:
  Event store for Account 123:
    1. AccountOpened {amount: 0}
    2. MoneyDeposited {amount: 1000}
    3. MoneyWithdrawn {amount: 300}
    4. MoneyDeposited {amount: 200}
    5. MoneyWithdrawn {amount: 400}

  Current state: Replay all events -> balance = $500
  State at event 3: Replay events 1-3 -> balance = $700
  Full audit trail: Every change is recorded forever

Event sourcing architecture:
  Command -> Aggregate (validates, produces events)
    -> Event Store (append-only, immutable)
      -> Projections (build read models from events)
        -> Read DB (optimized for queries)

  Write side: Validate command, append events
  Read side: Subscribe to events, build query-optimized views
  (This naturally leads to CQRS - separate read/write models)

Event Store requirements:
  - Append-only (events are immutable facts)
  - Ordered per aggregate (stream)
  - Optimistic concurrency (expected version on write)
  - Subscriptions (notify on new events)
  - Implementations: EventStoreDB, Kafka (as log),
    PostgreSQL (with proper schema), DynamoDB

When to use event sourcing:
  YES: Audit trail critical (finance, compliance)
       Need temporal queries (state at any time)
       Complex domain with rich business events
       CQRS already planned (natural fit)
       Need to rebuild read models (new projections)

  NO:  Simple CRUD (massive overkill)
      Don't need history (just current state)
      Team unfamiliar (steep learning curve)
      Simple reporting sufficient

Challenges:
  - Complexity: Event schema design, eventual consistency
  - Event evolution: Schema changes over time (versioning)
  - Replay time: Millions of events = slow rebuild
    Solution: Snapshots (periodic state checkpoints)
  - Debugging: Thinking in events is a paradigm shift
  - Storage: Events accumulate forever (plan capacity)
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Event Sourcing = store events (immutable facts), derive state by replaying. Enables: full audit trail, temporal queries, replay for debugging, rebuild read models from scratch.
2. Natural fit with CQRS: write side appends events (optimized for consistency), read side builds projections (optimized for queries). Different models for different concerns.
3. NOT for everything: massive complexity increase. Use for domains where audit trail, temporal queries, or event replay justify the cost (finance, compliance, complex domains). CRUD apps don't need it.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Event Sourcing stores immutable domain events as the source of truth with state derived by replay - I use it for audit-critical domains (finance, compliance) combined with CQRS projections for query-optimized reads, snapshots for replay performance, and schema versioning for event evolution over time."

# Schema Evolution

**TL;DR** - Schema evolution manages how message/event formats change over time without breaking producers or consumers - using compatibility rules (backward, forward, full), schema registries, and versioning strategies to enable independent service deployment.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
You add a field to an event. Old consumers crash (unknown field). Or you remove a field. New consumers crash (expected field missing). Every schema change requires coordinated deployment of ALL producers and consumers simultaneously. No independent deployment.

---

### How It Works

```
Compatibility types:
  BACKWARD compatible: New schema can read OLD data
    "I added an optional field with a default"
    Old producers' messages still readable by new consumers
    Safe to upgrade consumers first, then producers

  FORWARD compatible: Old schema can read NEW data
    "I added a field that old consumers can ignore"
    New producers' messages still readable by old consumers
    Safe to upgrade producers first, then consumers

  FULL compatible: Both backward AND forward
    "I added an optional field with default that can be ignored"
    Safest: upgrade producers and consumers in any order
    Hardest to achieve with all changes

  BREAKING: Neither backward nor forward
    "I renamed/removed a required field"
    Requires coordinated deployment (avoid!)

Safe schema changes (always compatible):
  + Add optional field with default value
  + Add new enum value (if consumer handles unknown)
  + Widen a type (int32 -> int64)

Unsafe schema changes (breaking):
  - Remove a field (forward-incompatible)
  - Rename a field (breaking)
  - Change field type (int -> string)
  - Make optional field required

Schema Registry (Confluent, AWS Glue):
  Registry stores schemas + enforces compatibility

  Producer: Register schema -> get schema ID
  Message: [schema_id (4 bytes) + serialized data]
  Consumer: Read schema_id -> fetch schema -> deserialize

  Registry rejects incompatible schema changes!
  Prevents breaking changes from reaching production.

Serialization formats:
  | Format   | Schema  | Evolution | Performance |
  |----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
  | JSON     | Optional| Manual    | Slow, large |
  | Avro     | Required| Built-in  | Fast, compact|
  | Protobuf | Required| Built-in  | Fast, compact|
  | Thrift   | Required| Built-in  | Fast, compact|

  Avro: Schema in registry, compact binary, best for Kafka
  Protobuf: Strong typing, generated code, gRPC native
  JSON: Human-readable, flexible, but no evolution guarantees
```

---

### Quick Recall

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Backward compatibility (new consumers read old messages) is the minimum requirement. Full compatibility (both directions) is ideal but restricts changes to adding optional fields with defaults.
2. Schema Registry enforces compatibility rules automatically: rejects breaking changes before they reach production. Use with Avro or Protobuf for Kafka messaging.
3. Safe changes: add optional fields with defaults. Unsafe changes: remove fields, rename fields, change types. For breaking changes: create a new topic/version (never modify in-place).

**Interview one-liner:**
"Schema evolution with a registry (Confluent/Glue) enforcing full compatibility using Avro serialization - I design events with optional fields and defaults for safe evolution, use the registry to reject breaking changes automatically, and create new topic versions when breaking changes are unavoidable rather than modifying existing schemas."
