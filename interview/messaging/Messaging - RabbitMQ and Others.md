# RabbitMQ

**TL;DR** - RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker implementing AMQP protocol, providing flexible routing (exchanges + bindings), message acknowledgment, dead letter queues, and priority queuing - best for complex routing patterns and traditional request/reply messaging where messages are consumed and deleted.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
You need flexible message routing: some messages go to one consumer, others fan out, others route based on content patterns. You need priority queuing, message TTL, delayed delivery. Kafka's topic-based model is too simple for these routing needs.

### How It Works

```
RabbitMQ architecture:
  Producer -> Exchange -> Binding -> Queue -> Consumer

  Exchange: Routes messages based on type and routing key
  Binding: Rule connecting exchange to queue
  Queue: Stores messages until consumed (then deleted)

RabbitMQ vs Kafka:
  | Feature       | RabbitMQ          | Kafka             |
  |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | Model         | Message broker    | Event log         |
  | After consume | Message deleted   | Message persists  |
  | Routing       | Complex (exchanges)| Simple (topics)  |
  | Replay        | No                | Yes               |
  | Throughput    | ~50K msg/s        | ~1M msg/s         |
  | Ordering      | Per-queue         | Per-partition      |
  | Consumer model| Push (broker->consumer)| Pull (consumer->broker)|
  | Best for      | Task queues, routing| Event streaming, replay|

When to choose RabbitMQ:
  - Complex routing requirements (content-based, headers)
  - Traditional work queues (task distribution)
  - Request/reply patterns (RPC over messaging)
  - Priority queuing needed
  - Messages should be deleted after processing
  - Lower throughput (< 50K msg/s)

When to choose Kafka:
  - Event streaming (log of events, replay)
  - High throughput (> 100K msg/s)
  - Multiple independent consumers (consumer groups)
  - Event sourcing, CDC
  - Long retention (days/weeks/forever)

RabbitMQ features:
  - Message TTL (expire after N seconds)
  - Dead letter exchanges (failed message routing)
  - Priority queues (process important messages first)
  - Delayed message plugin (schedule delivery)
  - Quorum queues (replicated for HA)
  - Streams (Kafka-like append-only, RabbitMQ 3.9+)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. RabbitMQ = smart broker (complex routing, messages deleted after consumption). Kafka = dumb broker (simple topics, messages persist for replay). Choose based on pattern needs.
2. RabbitMQ shines at: complex routing (exchange types), priority queues, delayed messages, request/reply (RPC), and task distribution with fair dispatch.
3. RabbitMQ push model (broker pushes to consumer) vs Kafka pull model (consumer pulls from broker). Push = lower latency, Pull = better back-pressure and batch control.

**Interview one-liner:**
"RabbitMQ for complex routing patterns (topic/header exchanges), traditional work queues with fair dispatch, and request/reply messaging - Kafka for event streaming, replay, high throughput, and multiple consumer groups. I choose RabbitMQ when routing flexibility and message-level features (TTL, priority, DLX) matter more than throughput."

# AMQP

**TL;DR** - AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard wire-level protocol for message-oriented middleware - defining how messages are formatted, routed, queued, and delivered, enabling interoperability between different message brokers and client libraries.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Every message broker has its own proprietary protocol. Switching from one broker to another requires rewriting all client code. No interoperability between different vendors. Vendor lock-in at the protocol level.

### How It Works

```
AMQP 0-9-1 model (RabbitMQ implements this):

  Connection: TCP connection to broker
  Channel: Lightweight virtual connection (multiplexed)
    (Multiple channels share one TCP connection)

  Message flow:
    Producer -> Exchange -> Binding Rule -> Queue -> Consumer

  Exchange types (routing logic):
    Direct:  Route by exact routing key match
    Topic:   Route by pattern matching (*.error, order.#)
    Fanout:  Broadcast to ALL bound queues (no key)
    Headers: Route by message header values

  Message properties:
    delivery_mode: 1 (transient) or 2 (persistent)
    content_type: "application/json"
    correlation_id: For request/reply matching
    reply_to: Queue for response
    expiration: TTL in milliseconds
    priority: 0-9 priority level

AMQP guarantees:
  At-most-once: auto-ack (ack before processing)
  At-least-once: manual ack (ack after processing)
    If consumer crashes: message redelivered
  Publisher confirms: Broker confirms receipt to producer

AMQP vs other protocols:
  | Protocol | Use Case        | Broker Support     |
  |----------|-----------------|-------------------|
  | AMQP     | Enterprise messaging | RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ |
  | MQTT     | IoT, mobile     | Mosquitto, HiveMQ  |
  | STOMP    | Simple text     | ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ |
  | Kafka Protocol | Streaming | Kafka only        |

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. AMQP is a protocol standard (like HTTP for web). RabbitMQ is the most popular AMQP broker. The protocol defines exchanges, queues, bindings, and message properties.
2. Exchange types: Direct (exact key match), Topic (pattern matching with \* and #), Fanout (broadcast to all), Headers (match on headers). This is AMQP's flexible routing power.
3. Channels multiplex over a single TCP connection (lightweight). Use one channel per thread. One connection per application (with many channels).

**Interview one-liner:**
"AMQP provides standardized message routing via exchanges (direct, topic, fanout, headers) with publisher confirms and consumer acknowledgments - I use channels for per-thread communication over shared connections, persistent delivery mode for critical messages, and manual ack for at-least-once processing guarantees."

# Exchanges and Bindings

**TL;DR** - Exchanges receive messages from producers and route them to queues based on exchange type and binding rules - direct (exact key match), topic (pattern matching), fanout (broadcast), and headers (attribute matching) - providing the flexible routing that distinguishes RabbitMQ from simpler brokers.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Without routing logic: every message goes to every queue (wasteful) or you need a separate queue per producer-consumer pair (explosion of queues). You need to route messages to the RIGHT consumers based on message properties.

### How It Works

```
Exchange types with examples:

1. DIRECT EXCHANGE (exact routing key match):
   Binding: queue="email-queue" routingKey="email"
   Binding: queue="sms-queue" routingKey="sms"

   Publish(routingKey="email", msg) -> email-queue only
   Publish(routingKey="sms", msg) -> sms-queue only
   Use for: Task routing by type

2. TOPIC EXCHANGE (pattern matching):
   Binding: queue="all-orders" pattern="order.#"
   Binding: queue="eu-errors" pattern="*.eu.error"

   Publish(routingKey="order.eu.placed") -> all-orders
   Publish(routingKey="order.eu.error") -> both queues!

   * = exactly one word
   # = zero or more words
   Use for: Hierarchical routing, selective subscription

3. FANOUT EXCHANGE (broadcast):
   Binding: queue="analytics" (no key needed)
   Binding: queue="audit-log" (no key needed)
   Binding: queue="notifications" (no key needed)

   Publish(msg) -> ALL three queues receive the message
   Use for: Event broadcasting, pub/sub

4. HEADERS EXCHANGE (attribute matching):
   Binding: queue="pdf-queue" headers={format: "pdf"}
   Binding: queue="urgent" headers={priority: "high"}

   Publish(headers={format:"pdf", priority:"high"}, msg)
     -> Both queues (matches headers of each)
   Use for: Complex multi-attribute routing

Dead Letter Exchange (DLX):
  Queue configured with: x-dead-letter-exchange="dlx"
  When message: rejected, expired (TTL), queue full
    -> Automatically routed to DLX -> DLQ
  Use for: Failed message handling, retry patterns

Retry pattern with DLX:
  Main Queue -> (fails 3x) -> DLX -> Retry Queue (with TTL)
    -> (TTL expires) -> Main Queue (retry)
  After max retries: route to Dead Letter Queue (permanent)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Four exchange types: Direct (exact key), Topic (pattern with \* and #), Fanout (broadcast all), Headers (match attributes). Choose based on routing complexity needed.
2. Topic exchange is the most versatile: "order.eu.placed" matches both "order.#" (all orders) and "_.eu._" (all EU events). Use dotted hierarchical routing keys.
3. Dead Letter Exchange (DLX) handles failed/expired messages automatically. Configure with retry queues (TTL-based delay) for automatic retry before permanent dead-lettering.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I use topic exchanges for hierarchical event routing (dotted keys with \* and # patterns), fanout for event broadcasting, direct for task distribution, and DLX with TTL-based retry queues for automatic message retry before dead-lettering - choosing exchange type based on the routing flexibility each consumer topology requires."

# ActiveMQ

**TL;DR** - Apache ActiveMQ is a mature Java-based message broker supporting multiple protocols (AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, OpenWire) and the JMS API - widely used in enterprise Java applications, with ActiveMQ Artemis as its modern high-performance successor.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Java enterprise applications need a JMS-compliant broker that integrates with Java EE/Jakarta EE containers, supports multiple protocols for different clients, and provides enterprise features (XA transactions, cluster, persistence).

### How It Works

```
ActiveMQ variants:
  Classic (5.x): Mature, widely deployed, slower
  Artemis (2.x): Modern rewrite, high-performance
    (Artemis is the future, Classic in maintenance mode)

ActiveMQ vs RabbitMQ vs Kafka:
  | Feature    | ActiveMQ       | RabbitMQ      | Kafka       |
  |-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
  | Protocol  | Multi (JMS,AMQP,MQTT)| AMQP     | Kafka protocol|
  | JMS       | Full support   | Plugin        | No          |
  | Java EE   | Native integration | External  | External    |
  | XA Trans  | Yes            | No            | No          |
  | Performance| Medium        | Medium-High   | Very High   |
  | Routing   | Selectors      | Exchanges     | Topics only |
  | Best for  | Enterprise Java| Polyglot routing| Streaming |

When to use ActiveMQ:
  - JMS API required (Java EE/Spring JMS)
  - Need multiple protocols (AMQP + MQTT + STOMP)
  - XA distributed transactions required
  - Existing Java EE infrastructure
  - Spring Boot with spring-jms (simplest path)

ActiveMQ Artemis improvements over Classic:
  - Non-blocking architecture (higher throughput)
  - Persistent messaging with journal (faster)
  - Built-in clustering and HA
  - Better resource management
  - Drop-in replacement with migration tool

Spring Boot integration:
  spring.artemis.broker-url=tcp://localhost:61616
  @JmsListener(destination = "order-queue")
  public void processOrder(Order order) {
    // Process message
  }
```

1. ActiveMQ = JMS-compliant broker for Java enterprise. If you need JMS API or Java EE integration, ActiveMQ (Artemis) is the natural choice.
2. ActiveMQ Artemis is the modern version (high-performance rewrite). Classic is in maintenance mode. New projects should use Artemis.
3. Multi-protocol support (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, OpenWire) makes ActiveMQ suitable when different clients need different protocols (IoT devices via MQTT + backend via JMS).

**Interview one-liner:**
"ActiveMQ Artemis for Java EE/Spring environments needing JMS compliance, XA transactions, and multi-protocol support (AMQP+MQTT+STOMP) - though for new greenfield projects without JMS requirements, I typically prefer RabbitMQ (better routing) or Kafka (streaming) based on the messaging pattern needed."

# Redis Pub/Sub

**TL;DR** - Redis Pub/Sub provides ultra-low-latency ephemeral messaging (messages are NOT persisted) - subscribers must be connected when messages are published, making it ideal for real-time notifications, chat, and live updates where message loss is acceptable.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Need to broadcast real-time updates to connected WebSocket clients. Kafka/RabbitMQ add unnecessary complexity and latency for ephemeral notifications where message persistence doesn't matter and sub-millisecond latency is critical.

### How It Works

```
Redis Pub/Sub model:
  PUBLISH channel message -> All current subscribers

  Key characteristic: FIRE AND FORGET
  - No persistence (message gone after delivery)
  - No acknowledgment (no retry if subscriber misses)
  - No history (late subscribers miss past messages)
  - Sub-millisecond latency (in-memory only)

  If subscriber is offline when message published:
    Message is LOST FOREVER. No recovery.

Redis Pub/Sub vs Redis Streams vs Kafka:
  | Feature      | Redis Pub/Sub | Redis Streams | Kafka      |
  |-------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
  | Persistence | No            | Yes           | Yes        |
  | Replay      | No            | Yes           | Yes        |
  | Consumer groups | No        | Yes           | Yes        |
  | Latency     | Sub-ms        | Sub-ms        | Low ms     |
  | Throughput  | Very high     | High          | Very high  |
  | Durability  | None          | Disk-backed   | Replicated |
  | Use case    | Real-time notify| Lightweight stream | Full streaming |

When to use Redis Pub/Sub:
  - Real-time WebSocket broadcasts
  - Cache invalidation across servers
  - Live typing indicators, online status
  - Inter-service notifications (ephemeral)
  - Chat messages (if loss acceptable, or backed by DB)

When NOT to use:
  - Messages must not be lost (use Kafka, RabbitMQ)
  - Need replay/history (use Kafka, Redis Streams)
  - Offline consumers should get messages (use queues)
  - Need consumer groups/load balancing (use Redis Streams)

Redis Streams (better alternative for most cases):
  XADD stream * field value (append to stream)
  XREAD GROUP group consumer ... (consumer group read)
  - Persistent, replayable, consumer groups
  - Still very fast (in-memory)
  - Recommended over Pub/Sub for new projects
    (unless you truly need fire-and-forget broadcast)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Redis Pub/Sub = fire-and-forget, zero persistence. If subscriber is offline, message is lost forever. Only use when message loss is acceptable.
2. Use cases: WebSocket broadcast, cache invalidation, real-time presence. NOT for: business events, payment processing, or anything requiring delivery guarantee.
3. Redis Streams > Redis Pub/Sub for most cases: persistent, replayable, consumer groups. Choose Streams unless you specifically need ephemeral broadcast with minimum latency.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Redis Pub/Sub for sub-millisecond ephemeral broadcasting (WebSocket notifications, cache invalidation) where message loss is acceptable - for anything requiring durability or replay, I use Redis Streams (same low latency, adds persistence and consumer groups) or Kafka for full streaming capabilities."

# NATS

**TL;DR** - NATS is a lightweight, high-performance messaging system designed for cloud-native architectures - providing pub/sub, request/reply, and queue groups with minimal operational complexity, and JetStream for persistence. Optimized for simplicity and low latency.

---

### The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Kafka is too complex for simple service communication. RabbitMQ requires exchange/binding configuration. You need a messaging system that "just works" with minimal setup - lightweight pub/sub for microservice communication without operational burden.

### How It Works

```
NATS core concepts:
  Subjects: Named channels (hierarchical, dot-separated)
    "orders.placed", "orders.shipped", "orders.*.failed"

  Patterns:
    Pub/Sub: Publish to subject, all subscribers receive
    Queue Groups: Load balance across subscribers in a group
    Request/Reply: Synchronous messaging over async transport

NATS characteristics:
  - At-most-once delivery (core NATS, no persistence)
  - Sub-millisecond latency
  - Minimal configuration (single binary, no deps)
  - Auto-discovery and clustering built-in
  - Leaf nodes for edge/IoT connectivity
  - Tiny footprint (~15MB RAM)

NATS JetStream (persistence layer):
  Added persistence, exactly-once, replay to NATS
  - Streams: Persistent, replayable message storage
  - Consumers: Durable with acknowledgment
  - Key-Value Store: Built-in KV (for config, state)
  - Object Store: Store large objects

  JetStream makes NATS competitive with Kafka for
  streaming use cases (simpler ops, slightly less throughput)

NATS vs others:
  | Feature     | NATS          | Kafka      | RabbitMQ    |
  |------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
  | Complexity | Very low      | High       | Medium      |
  | Latency    | Sub-ms        | Low ms     | Low ms      |
  | Persistence| JetStream     | Built-in   | Built-in    |
  | Throughput | High          | Very high  | Medium      |
  | Ops burden | Minimal       | Heavy      | Medium      |
  | Best for   | Microservices | Streaming  | Routing     |
  | Protocol   | NATS          | Kafka      | AMQP        |

When to use NATS:
  - Microservice communication (simple pub/sub)
  - Edge computing / IoT (tiny footprint)
  - Service mesh communication layer
  - Request/reply patterns (service discovery)
  - When operational simplicity is priority #1
  - Cloud-native, Kubernetes-native workloads
```

**Interview one-liner:**
"NATS for lightweight cloud-native messaging with minimal operational complexity - core NATS for fire-and-forget microservice communication, JetStream when I need persistence and replay without Kafka's operational weight, and queue groups for built-in load balancing across service instances."
