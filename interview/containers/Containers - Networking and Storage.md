# Container Networking

**TL;DR** - Container networking connects isolated containers to each other and the outside world using virtual network interfaces, bridges, and network namespaces - providing connectivity while maintaining isolation.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Containers have isolated network namespaces (by design). Without networking, they can't talk to each other, the host, or the internet. Your microservice architecture is useless if services can't communicate.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why container networking was created."

**EVOLUTION:**
Host networking (no isolation) -> Docker bridge networks (2013) -> Overlay networks for Swarm (2015) -> CNI standard for Kubernetes (2016) -> Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd, 2017+) -> eBPF-based networking (Cilium, 2020+).
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Container networking provides connectivity between containers using virtual networking constructs - virtual ethernet pairs (veth), bridges, NAT rules, and overlay networks - while preserving the isolation benefits of network namespaces.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Container networking creates virtual networks so isolated containers can communicate.

**One analogy:**

> Container networking is like a phone system in an office building. Each office (container) has its own phone number (IP). The building's PBX (bridge network) routes internal calls. External calls go through the switchboard (NAT/port mapping) to the outside world.

**One insight:**
Every container gets its own network namespace with its own IP address, routing table, and port space. Two containers can both listen on port 8080 without conflict because they're in different namespaces. The bridge network or port mapping determines how traffic reaches them.
---

### 🔩 First Principles Explanation

**CORE INVARIANTS:**

1. Each container has its own network namespace (isolated network stack)
2. Virtual ethernet pairs (veth) connect container namespace to bridge
3. Bridge acts as Layer 2 switch for container-to-container communication
4. NAT/iptables handle container-to-external communication

**DERIVED DESIGN:**
Isolation provides security (containers can't sniff each other's traffic by default). Bridges provide discovery (containers on same bridge can communicate). Port mapping provides external access (host port -> container port).

**THE TRADE-OFFS:**
**Gain:** Network isolation, port space independence, software-defined networking
**Cost:** Overhead (veth + bridge + NAT), complexity (debugging requires understanding virtual networking), performance (vs host networking)

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Docker Bridge Networking:

Host Network Stack
+------------------------------------------+
|  eth0: 192.168.1.100                     |
|                                          |
|  docker0 bridge: 172.17.0.1             |
|  +----------+  +----------+             |
|  | veth-a   |  | veth-b   |             |
|  +----+-----+  +----+-----+             |
|       |              |                   |
+-------+--------------+------------------+
        |              |
   +----+-----+  +----+-----+
   | Container A | | Container B |
   | eth0:      | | eth0:      |
   | 172.17.0.2 | | 172.17.0.3 |
   | Port: 8080 | | Port: 8080 |
   +------------+ +------------+

Traffic flow (A -> B):
  A sends to 172.17.0.3:8080
  -> through veth-a to bridge
  -> bridge forwards to veth-b
  -> arrives at B's eth0

Traffic flow (External -> A via port mapping):
  Client sends to 192.168.1.100:80
  -> iptables DNAT: 192.168.1.100:80 -> 172.17.0.2:8080
  -> through docker0 bridge to veth-a
  -> arrives at A's eth0:8080
```
---

### 🔄 Complete Picture - End-to-End Flow

**NORMAL FLOW:**
Container starts -> Docker creates veth pair -> one end in container namespace, one on bridge <- YOU ARE HERE -> container gets IP from bridge subnet -> iptables rules added for port mapping -> container can communicate

**FAILURE PATH:**
Container can't reach external network -> check iptables NAT rules (`iptables -t nat -L`) -> check IP forwarding (`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`) -> check bridge connectivity (`docker network inspect`)

**WHAT CHANGES AT SCALE:**
Single-host bridge works for Docker Compose. Multi-host requires overlay networks (VXLAN) or CNI plugins. At 1000+ pods in K8s, eBPF (Cilium) replaces iptables for performance (O(1) vs O(n) rule lookup). Service mesh adds L7 observability and mTLS.
---

### 💻 Code Example

```bash
# Create a custom bridge network
docker network create --subnet=10.0.0.0/24 mynet

# Run containers on custom network
docker run -d --name api --network mynet myapp
docker run -d --name db --network mynet postgres

# Containers reach each other by name
docker exec api ping db  # Works! DNS resolves

# Inspect network
docker network inspect mynet
# Shows containers, IPs, subnet

# Debug connectivity
docker exec api ip addr    # Container's IP
docker exec api ip route   # Container's routes
docker exec api nslookup db # DNS resolution
```

3. Custom networks enable DNS-based service discovery (containers reach each other by name)

"Container networking uses network namespaces for isolation, virtual ethernet pairs connected via a bridge for L2 connectivity, and iptables NAT for external access - with custom networks enabling DNS-based service discovery between containers."

4. **BUILD:** [TODO: Implement/configure in production context]
5. **EXTEND:** [TODO: Apply principle to a different domain]---

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

Docker's default bridge network does NOT support DNS-based container discovery - you must use `--link` (deprecated) or IP addresses. Only custom/user-defined bridge networks get automatic DNS. This catches many beginners who expect `docker run --name db` to be resolvable by name on the default network.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Container A can't reach Container B on the same Docker host. Walk me through your debugging steps.**

_Why they ask:_ Tests systematic network debugging skills.

**Answer:**
Systematic approach:

1. **Same network?**

   ```bash
   docker network inspect bridge | grep -A5 "Containers"
   # Both containers must be on the same network
   ```

2. **IP connectivity:**

   ```bash
   docker exec containerA ping <containerB_IP>
   # If this fails: bridge or veth issue
   ```

3. **DNS resolution (custom network only):**

   ```bash
   docker exec containerA nslookup containerB
   # Fails on default bridge - use custom network
   ```

4. **Port listening:**

   ```bash
   docker exec containerB ss -tlnp
   # Is the app actually listening on the expected port?
   ```

5. **Firewall/iptables:**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -L DOCKER -n
   # Check for blocking rules
   ```

Common causes: different networks, default bridge (no DNS), app bound to localhost (not 0.0.0.0), firewall rules, port mismatch.

# Volume Mounts

**TL;DR** - Volumes provide persistent storage for containers, surviving container restarts and removal by mounting host or managed storage into the container filesystem.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Container filesystem is ephemeral - when the container is removed, all data is lost. Your database container loses all records on restart. Your app's uploaded files vanish on redeployment.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Docker volumes were created."

**EVOLUTION:**
Data in container layer (lost on removal) -> Bind mounts from host (fragile, host-dependent) -> Named volumes (Docker-managed, portable) -> Volume plugins (network storage, cloud EBS/EFS) -> CSI drivers in Kubernetes (2018+).
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

A Docker volume is a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are stored outside the container's union filesystem layer, either managed by Docker (named volumes) or mapped directly from the host filesystem (bind mounts).
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Volumes are persistent storage that outlives the container.

**One analogy:**

> A volume is like an external USB drive plugged into a laptop (container). The laptop can be replaced (container restarted), but the USB drive (volume) keeps all files. Multiple laptops can share the same USB drive (multiple containers mounting the same volume).

**One insight:**
There are three types: (1) Named volumes (Docker-managed, `docker volume create`), (2) Bind mounts (host path directly), (3) tmpfs mounts (RAM-only, for secrets). Named volumes are preferred because they're portable and Docker manages the lifecycle.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Three storage types:

1. Named Volume (Docker-managed):
   docker run -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
   Stored: /var/lib/docker/volumes/pgdata/_data
   Lifecycle: survives container removal
   Use: databases, persistent state

2. Bind Mount (host directory):
   docker run -v /host/src:/app/src
   Stored: directly on host path
   Lifecycle: host filesystem lifecycle
   Use: development (live code reload)

3. tmpfs (RAM-only):
   docker run --tmpfs /run/secrets
   Stored: in memory only
   Lifecycle: gone when container stops
   Use: secrets, temp files

Container filesystem:
+--------------------------------+
| Writable Layer (ephemeral)     |

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

`docker rm` does NOT remove volumes. `docker system prune` does NOT remove volumes either. Volumes accumulate silently, potentially consuming hundreds of GBs. Only `docker volume prune` or explicit `docker volume rm` cleans them up. This is by design (safety), but it catches teams by surprise when disk fills up.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your containerized PostgreSQL database lost all data after a deployment. What happened and how do you prevent it?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of container storage lifecycle.

**Answer:**
Most likely causes:

1. **No volume mount** - data was in the writable container layer, lost on `docker rm`
2. **Anonymous volume** - `docker run -v /var/lib/postgresql/data` creates an anonymous volume that may not be reattached after `docker rm` and `docker run`
3. **docker-compose down -v** - the `-v` flag removes named volumes (data gone)
4. **Wrong mount path** - volume mounted to wrong directory, data written to container layer instead

Prevention:

```yaml
# Always use named volumes for databases
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  pgdata: # Named, explicit, survives `down`
```

Additionally:

- Backup volumes to external storage (S3, backup service)
- For production: use managed database services (RDS) instead of containerized databases
- Document that `docker-compose down -v` is destructive
- Use `external: true` for volumes that should never be auto-removed

# Docker Networking Modes

**TL;DR** - Docker provides four networking modes - bridge (default, isolated), host (no isolation), none (no networking), and overlay (multi-host) - each with different isolation, performance, and use case trade-offs.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
One-size-fits-all networking can't satisfy all needs: some containers need isolation, some need maximum performance, some need to be completely disconnected, and some need to span multiple hosts.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Docker offers multiple networking modes."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Docker networking modes define how a container's network namespace is configured: bridge (virtual switch with isolated subnet), host (shares host network namespace directly), none (no network interfaces), and overlay (VXLAN-based multi-host networking for Docker Swarm/K8s).
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Four modes: bridge (isolated), host (fast, no isolation), none (disconnected), overlay (multi-host).

**One analogy:**

> Bridge = apartment with its own mail slot. Host = living in the post office itself. None = no address, no mail. Overlay = mail system connecting buildings across a city.

**One insight:**
Bridge mode adds ~5% network overhead from NAT/bridge traversal. Host mode eliminates this but sacrifices port isolation (if the host already uses port 8080, the container can't). The right choice depends on whether you value isolation or performance.

| none    | Complete  | N/A         | Batch jobs,    |
|         |           |             | security       |

|         |           | (VXLAN)     | Swarm/K8s      |

bridge (default):

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: When would you use host networking instead of bridge?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests decision-making about performance vs isolation.

**Answer:**
Host networking makes sense when:

1. **High-throughput networking** (>10Gbps): bridge NAT overhead is measurable
2. **Monitoring agents** (Prometheus node exporter): needs access to host network metrics
3. **Service mesh sidecars**: sometimes need host network for iptables manipulation
4. **Legacy apps**: requiring specific network interfaces or multicast

NOT recommended when:

- Port conflicts possible (multiple containers needing same port)
- Security isolation required (container sees all host traffic)
- Portability needed (host networking is Linux-specific)

The trade-off: ~5% better throughput vs complete loss of network isolation. For most microservices, bridge is the right choice. For infrastructure daemons, host is appropriate.

# Port Mapping

**TL;DR** - Port mapping exposes container ports to the host using NAT (iptables DNAT rules), translating `host_port:container_port` to enable external access to containerized services.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Containers have their own network namespace. A service listening on port 8080 inside a container is unreachable from outside because the container's port 8080 is isolated from the host's port space.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why port mapping was created."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Port mapping (publishing) creates a NAT rule that forwards traffic arriving at a specific host port to a container's port, bridging the network namespace boundary and enabling external access to containerized services.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```bash
# Explicit mapping: host 80 -> container 8080
docker run -d -p 80:8080 myapp
# Clients access http://host:80
# Traffic NAT'd to container's 8080

# Random host port
docker run -d -p 8080 myapp
docker port myapp  # Shows assigned host port

# Bind to specific interface
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:80:8080 myapp
# Only accessible from localhost

# Multiple ports
docker run -d -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 myapp
```

```
NAT flow:
  Client -> host:80
    -> iptables DNAT rule
      -> 172.17.0.2:8080 (container)
        -> response follows reverse path

# DNS in Containers

**TL;DR** - Docker provides automatic DNS resolution for containers on custom networks, enabling service discovery by container/service name instead of hardcoded IP addresses.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Container IPs are dynamic - they change on every restart. Hardcoding `172.17.0.3` in your app's database connection string breaks when the database container restarts with a new IP.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why DNS-based container discovery was created."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Docker's embedded DNS server (127.0.0.11) resolves container names and service aliases to their current IP addresses on user-defined networks, providing dynamic service discovery without external DNS infrastructure.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
DNS resolution in Docker:

User-defined bridge network:
  Container "api" -> DNS query "db"
    -> Docker DNS server (127.0.0.11)
      -> Resolves to 172.18.0.3
        -> Connection to 172.18.0.3

Compose DNS:
  Service name = DNS name
  docker-compose.yml:
    services:
      api:        <- resolvable as "api"
      db:         <- resolvable as "db"
      cache:      <- resolvable as "cache"

  api connects to "db:5432" and "cache:6379"
  DNS handles IP changes on restart

Default bridge network:
  NO automatic DNS! Must use --link (deprecated)
  or IP addresses directly.
```

# Docker Compose Networking

**TL;DR** - Docker Compose automatically creates an isolated network for each project where services discover each other by name, with optional custom networks for multi-project or advanced topology control.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Running `docker-compose up` for 5 services requires manually creating networks, connecting containers, and managing DNS. Each developer would need to run networking commands before services can communicate.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Compose's automatic networking was created."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Docker Compose networking automatically creates a default bridge network named `<project>_default` for each Compose project, connects all services to it, and provides DNS-based service discovery using service names defined in the YAML file.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How would you design Compose networking for a microservices app with a frontend, API, database, and cache?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests network segmentation and security thinking.

**Answer:**

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    networks: [public]
  api:
    networks: [public, internal]
  db:
    networks: [internal]
  cache:
    networks: [internal]

networks:
  public: # frontend <-> api
  internal: # api <-> db, api <-> cache
```

Design principles:

1. **Least privilege**: DB/cache only on internal network - unreachable from frontend
2. **API as gateway**: only service on both networks - controls all data access
3. **External access**: only frontend and API expose ports to host
4. **Defense in depth**: even if frontend is compromised, attacker can't reach DB directly

This mirrors production network architecture where DMZ (public), application tier, and data tier have firewall rules between them.
