# Multi-Stage Build

**TL;DR** - Multi-stage builds use multiple FROM statements in a Dockerfile to separate build-time dependencies from runtime, producing minimal production images with only the application artifacts.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Your image contains the full SDK, build tools, test frameworks, and source code - none of which are needed at runtime. A Java app image is 1.2GB because it includes Maven, JDK, and the entire `.m2` cache alongside the 30MB JAR file.

**THE BREAKING POINT:**
Image pull takes 3 minutes. Registry storage costs are climbing. Attack surface is massive because every build tool is a potential vulnerability.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why multi-stage builds were created."

**EVOLUTION:**
Single-stage Dockerfiles (everything in one image) -> Builder pattern with scripts (build in one container, copy to another manually) -> Multi-stage builds (Docker 17.05, 2017) -> Named stages + `COPY --from` -> BuildKit parallel stage execution (2018+).
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

A multi-stage build is a Dockerfile feature that allows multiple `FROM` instructions, each starting a new build stage. Artifacts can be selectively copied between stages using `COPY --from=<stage>`, enabling build-time dependencies to be discarded from the final image.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Build in a fat image, run in a slim image - copy only what you need between them.

**One analogy:**

> Multi-stage builds are like a factory assembly line. The factory (build stage) has all the heavy machinery, raw materials, and tools. But only the finished product (JAR file, binary) gets shipped in a small box (runtime image) to the customer. You don't ship the factory.

**One insight:**
The final image only contains the last `FROM` stage plus anything explicitly `COPY --from`'d. Everything else - build tools, source code, intermediate artifacts - is automatically discarded.
---

### 🔩 First Principles Explanation

**CORE INVARIANTS:**

1. Each FROM starts a fresh image context (new filesystem)
2. COPY --from selectively transfers files between stages
3. Only the final stage determines the output image

**DERIVED DESIGN:**
Build stage uses full SDK (JDK + Maven: 500MB). Runtime stage uses minimal base (JRE Alpine: 100MB). Only the JAR file crosses the boundary. Result: 130MB instead of 1.2GB.

**THE TRADE-OFFS:**
**Gain:** 60-90% smaller images, reduced attack surface, faster pulls, lower storage costs
**Cost:** Slightly more complex Dockerfiles, cache management across stages, debugging build stage issues
---

### 🧠 Mental Model / Analogy

> A multi-stage build is like cooking at home vs ordering takeout. When cooking (build stage), your kitchen is full of ingredients, pots, knives, and spices. When the meal is served (runtime stage), only the plate and food arrive at the table. Nobody brings the kitchen.

Where this analogy breaks down: you can have more than 2 stages (e.g., test stage between build and runtime).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build (full SDK, tools, source)
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 \
    mvn dependency:go-offline -B
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests -B

# Stage 2: Test (optional, run tests)
FROM build AS test
RUN mvn verify

# Stage 3: Runtime (minimal, no build tools)
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -S app && adduser -S app -G app
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
USER app
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", \
  "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

```
Size comparison:
  Build stage (maven + JDK): ~800MB
  Runtime stage (JRE + JAR): ~180MB
  Savings: 77%
```
---

### 🔄 Complete Picture - End-to-End Flow

**NORMAL FLOW:**
Dockerfile parsed -> Stage 1 (build) executes -> Stage 2 (test) executes -> Stage 3 (runtime) executes <- YOU ARE HERE -> COPY --from=build brings JAR -> Final image = Stage 3 only -> Push ~180MB

**FAILURE PATH:**
Build fails in stage 1 -> debug with `docker build --target build` -> fix -> rebuild (BuildKit may parallelize independent stages)

**If you remember only 3 things:**

2. Name stages (`AS build`) for clarity and `COPY --from=build` for selective transfer
3. BuildKit parallelizes independent stages - design stages to be independent when possible

**Interview one-liner:**
"Multi-stage builds separate build-time dependencies from runtime by using multiple FROM stages, selectively copying only artifacts to a minimal final image - typically reducing image size by 60-90% and attack surface proportionally."

### ✅ Mastery Checklist

**You've mastered this when you can:**

3. **DECIDE:** [TODO: Choose this vs alternative under pressure]
4. **BUILD:** [TODO: Implement/configure in production context]
5. **EXTEND:** [TODO: Apply principle to a different domain]---

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

BuildKit can execute independent stages in parallel. If your Dockerfile has stages A, B, C where C depends on A but not B, BuildKit builds A and B simultaneously. This means a well-designed multi-stage Dockerfile can actually be FASTER than a single-stage one, not slower.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Design a multi-stage Dockerfile for a Java Spring Boot app that includes dependency caching, testing, and security hardening.**

_Why they ask:_ Tests comprehensive Docker optimization knowledge.

**Answer:**

```dockerfile
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17 AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 \
    mvn dependency:go-offline -B

FROM deps AS build
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests -B

FROM build AS test
RUN mvn verify

FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
RUN addgroup -S app && adduser -S app -G app
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar /app/app.jar
USER app
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
  CMD wget -q --spider \
  http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1
ENTRYPOINT ["java", \
  "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

Key design decisions:

- Separate `deps` stage: pom.xml changes are rare, deps layer is cached
- `test` stage: CI runs `--target test`, production skips it
- Alpine JRE: ~100MB vs ~400MB for full JDK Ubuntu
- Cache mount: Maven repo persists across builds
- Non-root, healthcheck, RAM percentage for production readiness

# Docker Layer

**TL;DR** - Docker layers are immutable, content-addressed filesystem deltas stacked via union mount (overlay2), where each Dockerfile instruction creates one layer and identical layers are shared across images.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Every image would be a complete filesystem copy. Pulling 5 images using the same Ubuntu base would download Ubuntu 5 times. Building would mean recreating the entire filesystem on every change.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Docker's layer system was created."

**EVOLUTION:**
Complete filesystem images -> AUFS union filesystem (Docker's first storage driver) -> OverlayFS (Linux kernel 3.18) -> overlay2 (default, 2017+) -> Content-addressable storage (Docker 1.10).
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

A Docker layer is an immutable, content-addressed filesystem delta representing the changes made by a single Dockerfile instruction. Layers are stacked using a union filesystem (overlay2), presenting a unified view while enabling deduplication, caching, and incremental distribution.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Each Dockerfile instruction creates one layer; layers stack and are shared across images.

**One analogy:**

> Layers are like version control commits. Each commit (layer) records what changed. You don't store the full file on every commit - just the diff. Multiple branches (images) can share common commit history (base layers).

**One insight:**
Layer caching is why instruction ORDER matters. If instruction 5 changes, instructions 1-4 use cache but 5+ rebuild. Put dependencies (rarely change) before source code (frequently changes).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
overlay2 filesystem:
+-------------------------------+
| Container Layer (writable)    | upperdir
+-------------------------------+
| Layer N: COPY app.jar (30MB)  | lowerdir
+-------------------------------+
| Layer 3: RUN npm install (80MB)| lowerdir
+-------------------------------+
| Layer 2: COPY package.json    | lowerdir
+-------------------------------+
| Layer 1: FROM node:20-alpine  | lowerdir
+-------------------------------+

Content addressing:
  sha256:a1b2... -> Layer 1 content
  sha256:c3d4... -> Layer 2 content

Sharing:
  Image A: [sha256:a1, sha256:c3, sha256:e5]
  Image B: [sha256:a1, sha256:c3, sha256:f6]
  On disk: sha256:a1 and sha256:c3 stored ONCE
```
---

### 🔄 Complete Picture - End-to-End Flow

**NORMAL FLOW:**
Dockerfile instruction -> filesystem changes captured as layer -> content-addressed (SHA256) -> stored in local cache <- YOU ARE HERE -> pushed to registry (only new layers) -> pulled by target (only missing layers)

**FAILURE PATH:**
Cache invalidation cascade: changing line 3 invalidates layers 3-N. `.dockerignore` missing causes all code changes to invalidate `COPY .` layer.
---

### 💻 Code Example

```bash
# View layers and their sizes
docker history myapp:1.0 --human

# Inspect which layers are shared
docker inspect myapp:1.0 | jq '.[0].RootFS.Layers'

# Analyze wasted space in layers
dive myapp:1.0  # Interactive layer explorer

# BAD: cleanup in separate layer (doesn't help)
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  # Still in layer above!

# GOOD: cleanup in same layer
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y build-essential && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Each Dockerfile instruction = one layer. Deleting files in a later layer doesn't reduce image size (previous layer still has them)
2. Layer caching: if instruction N changes, layers 1 to N-1 use cache, N+ are rebuilt. Order: stable first, volatile last
3. Identical layers are shared across images on disk and in registry - use common base images

**Interview one-liner:**
"Docker layers are immutable content-addressed filesystem deltas stacked via overlay2 union mount - enabling incremental builds through caching, storage efficiency through deduplication, and fast distribution by transferring only missing layers."

4. **BUILD:** [TODO: Implement/configure in production context]
5. **EXTEND:** [TODO: Apply principle to a different domain]---

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

The `docker history` command reveals that many popular images have layers with 0 bytes (metadata-only layers from ENV, EXPOSE, CMD instructions). These don't add size but DO affect cache invalidation. Moving metadata instructions to the end of the Dockerfile prevents unnecessary rebuilds of heavier layers above.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your image is 800MB. How do you identify which layers are largest and optimize?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical layer analysis skills.

**Answer:**

```bash
# Step 1: See layer sizes
docker history myapp:1.0 --no-trunc
# Find the 400MB layer from apt-get install

# Step 2: Deep analysis with dive
dive myapp:1.0
# Shows wasted space (files deleted in later layers)

# Step 3: Fix strategies
# a) Combine RUN + cleanup in one layer
# b) Multi-stage build (largest savings)
# c) Smaller base image (alpine/distroless)
# d) Remove unnecessary dependencies
```

The key insight: most image bloat comes from 2 sources - the base image (fix: use slim/alpine/distroless) and build dependencies that leak into the runtime image (fix: multi-stage builds).

# Distroless Images

**TL;DR** - Distroless images contain only the application and its runtime dependencies - no shell, no package manager, no OS utilities - reducing attack surface to the absolute minimum.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Your production container includes bash, apt-get, curl, wget, and hundreds of OS utilities. An attacker who exploits your app can use these tools to download malware, exfiltrate data, and pivot to other systems.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why distroless images were created."

**EVOLUTION:**
Full OS images (ubuntu, debian) -> Slim variants (python:slim) -> Alpine (5MB, musl libc) -> Distroless (Google, 2017, no shell at all) -> Chainguard images (2022, distroless + daily CVE patching) -> Wolfi (2023, distroless-friendly Linux distro).
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Distroless images are container base images that contain only the language runtime and application dependencies, with no OS-level package manager, shell, or standard Linux utilities. They are built from scratch using only the minimal set of files needed for the application to run.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
A distroless image is a container with nothing except your app - no shell to hack, no tools to abuse.

**One analogy:**

> A distroless image is like a vending machine vs a kitchen. The kitchen (full OS image) has knives, stove, utensils - all useful but dangerous in wrong hands. The vending machine (distroless) only dispenses one thing - there's nothing else to exploit.

**One insight:**
No shell means an attacker who gets RCE can't easily `wget` malware, `curl` an exfiltration endpoint, or `cat` sensitive files. They're stuck with whatever the application binary can do. This doesn't make you invulnerable, but it massively raises the exploitation cost.

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

Google runs virtually all of its production containers on distroless-like images. Internally, their build system (Bazel) produces images that contain only the application binary and its exact transitive dependencies - nothing else. This practice predates the public "distroless" project by years. The public images are simplified versions of what Google uses internally.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: A developer says "I can't use distroless because I need to debug inside the container." How do you address this concern?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests ability to balance security with operability.

**Answer:**
Debugging strategies for distroless:

1. **Ephemeral debug containers** (K8s 1.23+): `kubectl debug -it <pod> --image=busybox --target=app` shares the process namespace temporarily
2. **Debug image variant**: `gcr.io/distroless/java17:debug` includes busybox shell - use in staging only
3. **Remote debugging**: attach debugger via port (Java `-agentlib:jdwp`, Node `--inspect`)
4. **Observability**: proper logging + tracing (OpenTelemetry) eliminates 90% of debug reasons
5. **Sidecar tools**: deploy a debug sidecar pod alongside (shares network namespace)

The principle: debug tooling should be external to the production container. You don't install Wireshark on a production server; similarly, you don't add bash to a production container.

**TL;DR** - Image tag strategy defines how container images are versioned and referenced, with semantic version tags or SHA digests for production reproducibility and `:latest` reserved for development only.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Every image is tagged `:latest`. Production runs `myapp:latest` which was different last Tuesday. A rollback means "whatever :latest was yesterday" - but nobody knows what that was.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why image tag strategies were created."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

An image tag strategy is a naming convention for container image references that enables reproducible deployments, safe rollbacks, and clear artifact lineage from source commit to running container.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Tag images with immutable identifiers so you always know exactly what's running.

**One analogy:**

> Tags are like book editions. "The latest version" is ambiguous - which printing? Version tags ("3rd Edition, 2024") are unambiguous. SHA digests are like ISBNs - globally unique, immutable, machine-verifiable.

**One insight:**
Tags are mutable pointers - anyone can push a different image to the same tag. SHA digests (`@sha256:abc123...`) are immutable content addresses. Production deployments should reference digests, not tags, for guaranteed reproducibility.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Tagging strategies:

1. Semantic Version:
   myapp:1.0.0  myapp:1.0.1  myapp:1.1.0
   - Clear, human-readable
   - Supports rollback: "deploy myapp:1.0.0"

2. Git SHA:
   myapp:a1b2c3d
   - Traces to exact commit
   - CI-friendly (auto-generated)

3. Combined:
   myapp:1.2.3-a1b2c3d
   - Human version + commit traceability

4. SHA Digest (immutable):
   myapp@sha256:9f86d08...
   - Content-addressed, tamper-proof
   - Can't be overwritten

Anti-pattern:
   myapp:latest
   - Mutable, ambiguous, unreproducible
   - Different content on every push
```

3. For maximum security, pin to SHA digest (`@sha256:...`) which is immutable and tamper-proof

**Interview one-liner:**
"I use semantic version tags for readability with git SHA suffixes for traceability, and pin production deployments to SHA digests for immutability - never `:latest`, which is a mutable pointer that makes rollbacks impossible and reproducibility a fantasy."

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

`:latest` is NOT a special tag in Docker. It's just a convention - Docker applies it when you don't specify a tag. It doesn't auto-update, it doesn't mean "newest," and it's overwritten on every untagged push. Yet it's the most commonly used tag in production deployments worldwide.

# Container Registry

**TL;DR** - A container registry is a repository for storing, distributing, and managing container images, acting as the central artifact store between CI (build) and CD (deploy).
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Docker images exist only on the machine where they were built. Deploying to another machine means `docker save | scp | docker load` - slow, error-prone, no versioning, no access control.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why container registries were created."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

A container registry is a service that stores and distributes OCI-compliant container images and artifacts, providing features like access control, vulnerability scanning, image signing, and content replication.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
A registry is like npm/Maven Central but for container images.

**One analogy:**

> A registry is like a library system. Authors (CI) publish books (images) with ISBNs (tags/digests). Readers (deployment targets) check out books by reference. The library handles cataloging, access control, and interlibrary loans (replication).

**One insight:**
Registries store layers, not complete images. When you push an image that shares base layers with existing images, only new layers are transferred. This is why pushing a code-only change is fast (only the small top layer is new).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Registry ecosystem:
  Public:
    Docker Hub     - default, rate-limited
    ghcr.io        - GitHub Container Registry
    quay.io        - Red Hat

  Cloud-managed:
    ECR            - AWS, IAM-integrated
    ACR            - Azure, AAD-integrated
    GCR/Artifact   - GCP, IAM-integrated
    Registry

  Self-hosted:
    Harbor         - CNCF, full-featured
    Distribution   - OCI reference implementation

Push/Pull flow:
  docker push -> registry stores layers by digest
  docker pull -> registry sends only missing layers
  Layer deduplication across all images in registry
```

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your registry has 10TB of images. How do you manage storage costs?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests operational maturity with registries at scale.

**Answer:**

1. **Lifecycle policies** - auto-delete images older than N days, keep last N tags per repo
2. **Smaller images** - multi-stage builds, distroless, alpine (reduces storage by 60-80%)
3. **Layer deduplication** - use common base images across services (shared layers stored once)
4. **Immutable tags** - prevent accidental tag overwrites that create orphaned layers
5. **Garbage collection** - remove unreferenced layers (Harbor: automatic GC, ECR: lifecycle rules)
6. **Multi-arch manifests** - only pull architecture-specific layers (don't store unused platforms)

Cost breakdown: in most organizations, 80% of registry storage is old/unused image versions. Aggressive lifecycle policies (keep last 10 tags, delete untagged after 7 days) reduce storage by 70%+.

# BuildKit

**TL;DR** - BuildKit is Docker's modern build engine providing parallel stage execution, advanced caching (cache mounts, registry cache), secret injection, and SSH forwarding for faster, more secure builds.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Docker's legacy builder executes sequentially, has no remote caching, can't cache dependency downloads between builds, and has no way to inject secrets securely during build.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why BuildKit was created."

**EVOLUTION:**
Legacy Docker builder (sequential, basic cache) -> BuildKit (2018, parallel, advanced cache) -> Default builder in Docker 23.0+ -> Buildx (multi-platform builds on BuildKit).
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

BuildKit is a concurrent, cache-efficient build toolkit that replaces Docker's legacy builder. It features parallel execution of independent build stages, content-based caching, secret and SSH agent forwarding, multi-platform builds, and pluggable output formats.
---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
BuildKit makes Docker builds faster and more secure with parallelism and advanced caching.

**One analogy:**

> Legacy builder is like a single-lane road (sequential). BuildKit is a multi-lane highway (parallel stages). It also has express lanes (cache mounts for dependencies) and secure delivery trucks (secret mounts that never touch image layers).

**One insight:**
The biggest BuildKit win isn't parallelism - it's `--mount=type=cache`. This persists dependency caches (Maven `.m2`, npm `node_modules`, Go modules) between builds, turning a 5-minute dependency download into a 3-second cache hit.

BuildKit features:

                               |--> Stage C (final image)
   Stage B (build backend)  --|
   A and B run simultaneously

2. Cache mounts (persist between builds):
   RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 \
       mvn package
   # Maven repo cached on host, reused next build

3. Secret mounts (never in image layer):
   RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npmrc \
       npm install --userconfig /run/secrets/npmrc
   # .npmrc available during build, not in layer

4. SSH forwarding:
   RUN --mount=type=ssh \
       git clone git@github.com:org/repo.git
   # SSH key forwarded, never stored in image
```

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

BuildKit can build images without Docker installed. `buildctl` (BuildKit's CLI) is a standalone builder. This means CI systems don't need Docker-in-Docker (DinD) - they can use BuildKit directly, which is simpler, faster, and more secure. Google's `kaniko` and Red Hat's `buildah` followed this same "buildable without Docker daemon" philosophy.

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: Your CI builds take 10 minutes per service. You have 50 services. How do you speed up builds?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests CI optimization at scale.

**Answer:**
Layered optimization approach:

1. **Cache mounts** (immediate win):

   ```dockerfile
   RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 mvn package
   ```

   Saves 3-5 minutes per build (no re-downloading deps).

2. **Registry cache** (CI cache sharing):

   ```bash
   docker buildx build \
     --cache-from type=registry,ref=myapp:cache \
     --cache-to type=registry,ref=myapp:cache .
   ```

   Builds on any CI agent benefit from previous builds.

3. **Parallel stages** (design Dockerfile for parallelism):
   Independent build stages execute concurrently.

4. **Monorepo optimization**: only build services that changed (detect via git diff + path-based triggers).

5. **Remote builders**: BuildKit remote workers (dedicated build machines with warm caches).

Combined impact: 10-minute builds -> 2-3 minutes. 50 services x 7-minute savings = 350 engineer-minutes saved per CI run.
