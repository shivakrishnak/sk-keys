# Blue-Green Deployment

**TL;DR** - Blue-green deployment maintains two identical production environments (blue=current, green=new), routes traffic from blue to green after validation, and keeps blue as instant rollback - zero-downtime with full environment isolation.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Deployment means in-place update. During the update, the system is in a mixed state. If the new version fails, rolling back requires re-deploying the old version (which takes time). No instant rollback.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why blue-green deployment was invented."

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Blue-green deployment is a release technique using two identical production environments (blue and green). At any time, one serves live traffic while the other is idle or being prepared. Deployment targets the idle environment; traffic is switched after validation, with the previous environment available for instant rollback.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Blue-Green flow:
  Step 1: Blue is live, Green is idle
    [Load Balancer] --> [Blue v1.0] (serving traffic)
                        [Green] (idle)

  Step 2: Deploy v2.0 to Green
    [Load Balancer] --> [Blue v1.0] (still serving)
                        [Green v2.0] (deployed, testing)

  Step 3: Validate Green (smoke tests, health checks)
    Test against Green directly (internal URL)

  Step 4: Switch traffic to Green
    [Load Balancer] --> [Green v2.0] (now serving)
                        [Blue v1.0] (idle = rollback target)

  Rollback: Switch LB back to Blue (seconds)

Implementation options:
  - DNS switch (slow: TTL propagation)
  - Load balancer switch (fast: immediate)
  - K8s Service selector change (fast)
  - Cloud: swap deployment slots (Azure)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Two full environments. Only one serves traffic. Deploy to idle, test, switch. Rollback = switch back (instant).
2. Cost: 2x infrastructure during deployment (both environments running). Worth it for critical systems needing instant rollback.
3. Database challenge: both environments share the same DB. Schema changes must be backward-compatible (expand-contract migration pattern).

**Interview one-liner:**
"Blue-green gives instant rollback by maintaining two production environments - deploy to idle, validate, switch traffic via LB - the main challenge is database schema compatibility requiring expand-contract migrations since both versions briefly share the same DB."

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

[TODO: 2-4 sentences. One counterintuitive fact.
 Specific. Makes this concept permanently memorable.]

---

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you handle database migrations with blue-green deployments?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests understanding of the hardest part of blue-green.

**Answer:**
The problem: Blue (v1) and Green (v2) share the same database. If v2 migration breaks v1's queries, you can't rollback to Blue.

Solution: Expand-Contract pattern

1. **Expand** (deploy with v2): Add new columns/tables alongside old ones. Both versions work.
2. **Migrate**: Copy/transform data to new structure (background job)
3. **Contract** (separate deploy after v1 retired): Remove old columns/tables.

Example: Rename column `name` to `full_name`

- Bad: `ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN name TO full_name` (breaks v1)
- Good:
  1. Add `full_name` column, write to both (v2 deploy)
  2. Backfill `full_name` from `name`
  3. Switch reads to `full_name` (v3 deploy)
  4. Drop `name` column (v4 deploy, after v2 is gone)

Rule: Every migration must be backward-compatible with N-1 version.

# Canary Deployment

**TL;DR** - Canary deployment routes a small percentage of traffic to the new version (1%, 5%, 10%), monitors error rates and latency, and progressively increases traffic if healthy - catching production issues before full rollout with minimal blast radius.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Blue-green is all-or-nothing (100% of traffic switches). You've tested in staging, but production has different traffic patterns, data, and scale. The first sign of a bug affects all users simultaneously.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why canary deployments were created."

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Canary deployment is a progressive release technique that routes a small subset of production traffic to the new version while the majority continues using the current version, enabling real-world validation with minimal user impact. Traffic percentage increases incrementally based on health metrics.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Canary progression:
  Time 0:   [v1: 100%] [v2: 0%]  - Deploy canary
  Time +5m: [v1: 99%]  [v2: 1%]  - Initial traffic
  Time +15m:[v1: 95%]  [v2: 5%]  - Metrics healthy? Increase
  Time +30m:[v1: 90%]  [v2: 10%] - Still healthy? Increase
  Time +1h: [v1: 50%]  [v2: 50%] - High confidence
  Time +2h: [v1: 0%]   [v2: 100%]- Full rollout

  At ANY step, if metrics degrade:
    -> Automatic rollback to [v1: 100%]

Metrics to watch (canary analysis):
  - Error rate (5xx responses)
  - Latency (p50, p95, p99)
  - Saturation (CPU, memory)
  - Business metrics (conversion rate, cart adds)

Tools:
  - Argo Rollouts (K8s-native progressive delivery)
  - Flagger (automated canary with Istio/Linkerd)
  - AWS App Mesh + CloudWatch
  - Istio VirtualService traffic splitting
```

```yaml
# Argo Rollouts canary strategy
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 5
        - pause: { duration: 5m }
        - analysis:
            templates:
              - templateName: success-rate
        - setWeight: 25
        - pause: { duration: 10m }
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 15m }
        - setWeight: 100
```

# Rolling Deployment

**TL;DR** - Rolling deployment gradually replaces instances of the old version with the new version one at a time (or in batches), maintaining overall capacity while never having all instances on the same version during the transition.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
All instances updated simultaneously = downtime during update. Blue-green requires 2x infrastructure. Need a middle ground that maintains availability with minimal extra resources.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Rolling deployment incrementally replaces instances of the previous application version with instances of the new version, ensuring a minimum number of instances are always available during the transition. Controlled by max-surge (extra instances allowed) and max-unavailable (instances that can be down).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Rolling deployment (4 instances, batch size 1):
  Step 1: [v1] [v1] [v1] [v1]    - Current state
  Step 2: [v1] [v1] [v1] [v2...]  - Start one new
  Step 3: [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]     - One old removed
  Step 4: [v1] [v2] [v2] [v2...]  - Continue
  Step 5: [v2] [v2] [v2] [v2]     - Complete

Comparison:
  | Strategy    | Downtime | Rollback speed | Infra cost |
  |-------------|----------|----------------|------------|
  | Recreate    | Yes      | Slow (redeploy)| 1x         |
  | Rolling     | No       | Medium (roll)  | 1x + surge |
  | Blue-Green  | No       | Instant        | 2x         |
  | Canary      | No       | Instant        | 1x + small |

Rolling deployment challenges:
  - Two versions run simultaneously (compatibility!)
  - Rollback takes as long as deploy (re-roll)
  - No instant rollback (unlike blue-green)
  - Session affinity can cause uneven distribution

3. Rollback is slow (re-roll to previous version) compared to blue-green (instant switch) or canary (instant revert)

**Interview one-liner:**
"Rolling deployment is the Kubernetes default - it gradually replaces pods maintaining availability with configurable maxSurge/maxUnavailable, but requires backward-compatible changes since both versions coexist, and rollback takes as long as the original deployment unlike instant blue-green switches."

# Feature Flags

**TL;DR** - Feature flags (toggles) are runtime switches that decouple deployment from release - code is in production but hidden behind flags, enabling progressive rollout, instant kill switches, A/B testing, and trunk-based development.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Deploy = Release. The moment code is in production, all users see it. Half-built features require long-lived branches. Instant rollback requires redeployment. No way to release to specific user segments.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why feature flags were created."

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Feature flags are conditional statements in code that enable runtime control over feature visibility without code deployment. They enable progressive rollout (percentage-based), targeted release (user segments), A/B testing, and instant feature deactivation (kill switch).

### ⚙️ How It Works

```java
// Feature flag in application code
if (featureFlags.isEnabled("new-checkout", user)) {
    return newCheckoutFlow(user);
}
return legacyCheckoutFlow(user);

// Progressive rollout configuration:
// {
//   "new-checkout": {
//     "enabled": true,
//     "rollout_percentage": 10,
//     "targeting": {
//       "beta_users": true,
//       "country": ["US", "UK"]
//     }
//   }
// }
```

```
Flag types:
  Release flag:    Hide incomplete feature (short-lived)
  Experiment flag: A/B test variations (time-boxed)
  Ops flag:        Kill switch for features under load
  Permission flag: Premium features per user tier

Lifecycle (CRITICAL - flags create tech debt):
  Create -> Enable for testing -> Gradual rollout
    -> 100% rollout -> REMOVE FLAG AND OLD CODE

Tools:
  LaunchDarkly:  Enterprise, SDKs for all languages
  Unleash:       Open-source, self-hosted
  Flagsmith:     Open-source + managed
  Split:         Feature flags + experimentation
  Custom:        Config file/DB (simple but limited)

Dangers of flag debt:
  Unreferred flags pile up -> combinatorial complexity
  Flag A ON + Flag B OFF = tested?
  Flag A OFF + Flag B ON = tested?
  N flags = 2^N possible states (unmaintainable)
  RULE: Remove flags within 2 weeks of full rollout

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Deploy != Release. Code in production but invisible until flag enabled. Instant enable/disable without deployment.
2. Flag types: release (short-lived, remove after rollout), ops (kill switch), experiment (A/B test, time-boxed)
3. CRITICAL: Remove flags after full rollout. Flag debt is worse than tech debt - 2^N untested state combinations.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Feature flags decouple deployment from release - I use them for trunk-based development (hide incomplete work), progressive rollouts (1% -> 100%), instant kill switches for incidents, and A/B testing - with strict hygiene rules requiring flag removal within 2 weeks of full rollout to prevent combinatorial state explosion."

# A/B Testing

**TL;DR** - A/B testing (split testing) routes different user segments to different feature variants, measuring statistical impact on business metrics to make data-driven product decisions - requires feature flags and proper statistical methodology.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Product decisions based on opinions ("I think users prefer blue buttons"). Ship a change, metrics move - but was it the change or seasonal variation? No controlled experiment, no statistical significance, no causal proof.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

A/B testing is a controlled experiment where users are randomly assigned to variants (A=control, B=treatment) and business metrics are measured to determine if the treatment produces a statistically significant improvement, requiring proper sample size, randomization, and statistical analysis.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
A/B Test flow:
  1. Hypothesis: "New checkout reduces cart abandonment"
  2. Variants: A = current checkout, B = new checkout
  3. Split: 50% users see A, 50% see B (random)
  4. Measure: Conversion rate, revenue, errors
  5. Duration: Run until statistically significant
  6. Decide: B wins -> roll out. B loses -> revert.

Technical implementation:
  User request -> Hash(user_id) -> Assign variant
    -> Feature flag routes to A or B
      -> Track events (viewed, clicked, purchased)
        -> Analytics pipeline aggregates
          -> Statistical test (significance?)

Statistical rigor:
  - Sample size calculator BEFORE starting
  - Don't peek (stopping early inflates false positives)
  - Run for full business cycle (weekday + weekend)
  - Multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni)
  - Minimum detectable effect (MDE) defined upfront

Common mistakes:
  - Stopping test when results "look good" (peeking)
  - Too many variants (need huge sample size)
  - Changing test mid-flight (invalidates results)
  - Ignoring novelty effect (users try new things)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

2. Statistical significance required before deciding (p < 0.05 or Bayesian credible interval). Don't peek and stop early.
3. Technical stack: feature flags (assign variant) + event tracking (measure behavior) + analytics (statistical test)

**Interview one-liner:**
"A/B testing uses controlled randomized experiments via feature flags to measure causal impact of changes on business metrics - I ensure proper sample size calculation upfront, full business-cycle duration, and statistical significance before declaring winners."

# Progressive Delivery

**TL;DR** - Progressive delivery extends continuous delivery with gradual rollouts (canary, blue-green), automated analysis, and traffic management - giving operators fine-grained control over who sees new versions and when, with automated rollback on degradation.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Continuous deployment is binary: either everything auto-deploys to all users, or there's a manual gate. No middle ground between "full automation" and "manual approval." Teams want automation WITH safety controls.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why progressive delivery was formalized."

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Progressive delivery is an umbrella term for deployment strategies that give teams gradual control over release exposure, combining techniques like canary analysis, feature flags, traffic splitting, and automated rollback to reduce the blast radius of failed deployments while maintaining deployment velocity.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Progressive Delivery = CI/CD + Fine-grained control

Traditional CD:
  Build -> Test -> Deploy to ALL users

Progressive Delivery:
  Build -> Test -> Deploy to 1% -> Analyze
    -> 5% -> Analyze -> 25% -> Analyze
      -> 100% (OR rollback at any step)

Components:
  1. Traffic management (route % of requests)
  2. Canary analysis (compare metrics automatically)
  3. Feature flags (control feature visibility)
  4. Automated rollback (revert on degradation)
  5. Observability (metrics to make decisions)

Tooling stack:
  Argo Rollouts:  K8s-native progressive delivery
  Flagger:        Automated canary + A/B with mesh
  LaunchDarkly:   Feature flag progressive rollout
  Split.io:       Experimentation + progressive delivery
  Harness:        Full CD platform with verification

Maturity levels:
  L1: Rolling updates (basic K8s default)
  L2: Blue-green (instant rollback)
  L3: Canary (percentage-based rollout)
  L4: Automated canary analysis (metrics-driven)
  L5: Full progressive (flags + canary + auto-analysis
      + automated rollback + experimentation)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Progressive delivery = CD + gradual exposure control. Not a single tool but a combination of canary + flags + analysis + auto-rollback.
2. Key differentiator from basic CD: automated metric analysis deciding whether to proceed or rollback (not just "deploy and hope")
3. Maturity progression: rolling -> blue-green -> canary -> automated analysis -> full progressive delivery with experimentation

**Interview one-liner:**
"Progressive delivery extends CD with graduated exposure control - combining canary deployments (traffic splitting), automated metric analysis (comparing against baseline), feature flags (user segment targeting), and automated rollback - giving teams deployment velocity with safety guarantees through tools like Argo Rollouts and Flagger."
