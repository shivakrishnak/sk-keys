# SAST

**TL;DR** - Static Application Security Testing analyzes source code (without executing it) to find vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and hardcoded secrets early in the development lifecycle - shift-left security integrated into CI pipelines.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Security vulnerabilities discovered in production after deployment. Penetration tests find issues months after code was written. Fixing a vulnerability in production costs 30x more than catching it during development.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why SAST was created - shift security left."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Static Application Security Testing is a white-box testing methodology that analyzes application source code, bytecode, or binary for security vulnerabilities by modeling code execution paths without actually running the application, identifying issues like injection flaws, insecure configurations, and sensitive data exposure.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
SAST in CI pipeline:
  Commit -> Build -> [SAST Scan] -> Test -> Deploy
                         |
                         v
  Report: SQL Injection found
    File: UserRepository.java:45
    Severity: Critical
    Rule: CWE-89
    Fix: Use parameterized queries

Tools:
  SonarQube:     Multi-language, quality + security
  Semgrep:       Fast, custom rules, open-source
  CodeQL:        GitHub-native, deep semantic analysis
  Checkmarx:     Enterprise, comprehensive
  Snyk Code:     Developer-friendly, IDE integration

Pipeline integration:
  - Run on every PR (block merge on critical/high)
  - Full scan nightly (catch things PR scans miss)
  - IDE plugins (catch before commit)
  - Baseline: suppress existing issues, alert on new

False positive management:
  - Triage and suppress confirmed false positives
  - Custom rules for your codebase patterns
  - Severity-based gating (block critical, warn high)
  - Track suppression count (too many = problem)
```

```yaml
# GitHub Actions SAST with Semgrep
- name: Semgrep SAST
  uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
  with:
    config: >-
      p/owasp-top-ten
      p/java
    generateSarif: true
- name: Upload SARIF
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: semgrep.sarif

3. False positives are the #1 adoption barrier. Tune rules, baseline existing issues, and only gate on high-confidence findings.

**Interview one-liner:**
"SAST scans source code for vulnerabilities pre-execution - I integrate Semgrep or CodeQL in PR checks blocking on critical findings (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets), with baseline suppression for existing issues and custom rules for our codebase patterns to manage false positive rates."

# DAST

**TL;DR** - Dynamic Application Security Testing tests a running application by sending crafted requests (like a real attacker would), finding runtime vulnerabilities that SAST misses - authentication issues, server misconfigurations, and injection flaws in actual behavior.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
SAST finds code patterns but can't test runtime behavior. Is that WAF actually blocking SQLi? Does the auth correctly prevent session fixation? Does the server expose sensitive headers? Only testing the running system reveals runtime security issues.
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Dynamic Application Security Testing is a black-box testing methodology that tests a running application from the outside by sending crafted HTTP requests to identify vulnerabilities that manifest at runtime - including authentication flaws, server misconfigurations, injection vulnerabilities in deployed behavior, and business logic flaws.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
DAST in CI pipeline:
  Build -> Deploy to Staging -> [DAST Scan] -> Report

  DAST scanner:
    1. Crawls the application (discovers endpoints)
    2. Sends attack payloads (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, etc.)
    3. Analyzes responses for vulnerability indicators
    4. Reports confirmed findings with reproduction steps

Tools:
  OWASP ZAP:    Open-source, CI-friendly, baseline scan
  Burp Suite:   Enterprise, comprehensive
  Nuclei:       Template-based, fast, community rules
  StackHawk:    Developer-focused DAST in CI
  Invicti:      Enterprise, proof-based scanning

SAST vs DAST:
  | Aspect     | SAST             | DAST              |
  |------------|------------------|-------------------|
  | Input      | Source code      | Running app       |
  | Type       | White-box        | Black-box         |
  | Stage      | Build time       | After deployment  |
  | Finds      | Code patterns    | Runtime behavior  |
  | False pos  | Higher           | Lower             |
  | Coverage   | All code paths   | Reachable paths   |
  | Speed      | Fast (minutes)   | Slow (30+ min)    |

Both are needed: SAST + DAST = comprehensive coverage
```

# Supply Chain Security

**TL;DR** - Supply chain security protects the software build and delivery pipeline from tampering - verifying dependencies (SCA), signing artifacts (cosign), generating provenance (SLSA), and scanning images (Trivy) to ensure what you deploy is what you built from trusted sources.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
SolarWinds (2020): attackers compromised the build pipeline, inserting malware into a signed update distributed to 18,000 customers. Log4Shell (2021): a vulnerability in a transitive dependency affected millions of applications. Supply chain attacks bypass all application-level security.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why supply chain security became critical."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Software supply chain security encompasses practices and tools that verify the integrity, provenance, and security of all components in the software delivery pipeline - from source code dependencies through build systems to deployment artifacts - ensuring nothing is tampered with or vulnerable.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Supply Chain Security layers:

1. Dependency Management (SCA):
   - Scan dependencies for known CVEs
   - Tools: Dependabot, Snyk, Renovate, Trivy
   - Lock files (package-lock.json, go.sum)
   - Audit: npm audit, mvn dependency-check

2. Build Integrity (SLSA):
   - Hermetic builds (isolated, reproducible)
   - Build provenance (signed attestation of what/how)
   - SLSA levels: L1 (documented) to L4 (hermetic)
   - Tools: SLSA framework, in-toto, Sigstore

3. Artifact Signing:
   - Sign container images after build
   - Verify signatures before deployment
   - Tools: cosign (Sigstore), Notary v2
   - Admission controller rejects unsigned images

4. Image Scanning:
   - Scan for OS and language vulnerabilities
   - Block deployment of critical CVEs
   - Tools: Trivy, Grype, Clair
   - Scan on push + periodic re-scan

5. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):
   - List all components in an artifact
   - Formats: SPDX, CycloneDX
   - Required for compliance (US EO 14028)
   - Tools: syft, trivy sbom

Pipeline integration:
  Source -> [SCA scan deps] -> Build [hermetic]
    -> [Sign artifact] -> [Scan image]
      -> [Generate SBOM + provenance]
        -> [Verify signature on deploy]
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Four pillars: dependency scanning (SCA), artifact signing (cosign), image scanning (Trivy), and provenance attestation (SLSA)
2. Sign images after build, verify before deploy (admission controller). Unsigned or unverified = rejected.
3. SBOM is now a regulatory requirement (US Executive Order 14028). Generate with Syft, distribute with artifacts.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I implement defense-in-depth supply chain security: dependency scanning in PR (Dependabot/Snyk), hermetic builds generating SLSA provenance, cosign image signing, Trivy scanning blocking critical CVEs, and admission controller verifying signatures before deployment - with SBOM generation for compliance."

# Quality Gates

**TL;DR** - Quality gates are automated pass/fail checkpoints in CI/CD pipelines that enforce minimum quality thresholds (test coverage, code smells, security findings, performance) - preventing substandard code from reaching production.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Quality degrades gradually. Each commit is "just a little worse." Over months, test coverage drops from 80% to 40%. Code smells accumulate. Technical debt compounds. Nobody notices until the system is unmaintainable.
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Quality gates are automated enforcement points in a CI/CD pipeline that evaluate code against predefined quality criteria (coverage thresholds, duplication limits, security finding counts, performance benchmarks) and block promotion to the next stage if criteria are not met.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Quality Gate checkpoints:

PR Quality Gate (pre-merge):
  - Test coverage >= 80% (new code >= 90%)
  - No new critical/high SAST findings
  - No new code smells above threshold
  - All tests pass
  - Linting passes (zero errors)
  - PR size < 400 lines (guideline, not hard gate)

Staging Quality Gate (pre-production):
  - Integration tests pass (100%)
  - Performance: p99 latency < 200ms
  - No critical vulnerabilities in image scan
  - Smoke tests pass
  - API contract tests pass

Production Quality Gate (post-deploy):
  - Error rate < 0.1% (canary vs baseline)
  - Latency within 10% of baseline
  - No increase in exception count
  - Health check passes for 5 minutes
  - If fails: automatic rollback

SonarQube Quality Gate example:
  Conditions:
    - Coverage on new code >= 80%
    - Duplicated lines on new code <= 3%
    - Maintainability rating = A
    - Reliability rating = A
    - Security rating = A
    - Security hotspots reviewed = 100%

**Interview one-liner:**
"I implement tiered quality gates: PR-level (coverage on new code >= 80%, zero critical SAST findings, lint clean), staging (integration tests, performance baseline, image scan clean), and production (error rate comparison with automated rollback) - gating on new code metrics to avoid blocking legacy improvements."

# Secrets Management in CI

**TL;DR** - Secrets management in CI/CD ensures credentials, tokens, and keys are injected securely into pipelines without being stored in code, logs, or artifacts - using vault integration, short-lived tokens, OIDC federation, and environment isolation.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Database passwords in environment variables visible in CI logs. AWS keys stored as "secrets" but accessible to anyone who can edit a workflow. Long-lived credentials shared across all pipelines. One compromised pipeline exposes everything.
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

CI/CD secrets management encompasses practices and tools for securely storing, accessing, rotating, and auditing sensitive credentials used in build and deployment pipelines - including environment-specific isolation, just-in-time access, and prevention of secret exposure in logs and artifacts.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Secret injection approaches (worst to best):

1. Environment variables in CI config (BAD):
   Visible in CI UI, accessible to all workflows
   Often logged accidentally

2. CI platform secrets (BETTER):
   GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI variables
   Masked in logs, scoped to repo/environment
   But: still long-lived, broad access

3. OIDC federation (BEST for cloud):
   No stored credentials at all!
   CI assumes cloud role via short-lived JWT
   GitHub Actions -> AWS OIDC -> temporary creds

4. External vault integration (BEST overall):
   HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
   Just-in-time access, short-lived, audited
   Rotation without pipeline changes
```

```yaml
# GitHub Actions: OIDC with AWS (no stored secrets!)
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      id-token: write # Required for OIDC
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123:role/deploy
          aws-region: us-east-1
          # No access keys stored anywhere!
          # JWT exchanged for short-lived STS credentials

      # Anti-pattern: stored long-lived key
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_KEY }} # BAD
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET }}
```

```
Secret hygiene rules:
  1. NEVER log secrets (mask in CI, scrub outputs)
  2. OIDC over stored credentials (no secret to leak)
  3. Scope secrets to environment (prod secrets != dev)
  4. Rotate credentials regularly (automated)
  5. Audit access (who used which secret, when)
  6. Short-lived tokens (expire in minutes, not months)
  7. Least privilege (deploy role != admin role)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. OIDC federation eliminates stored credentials entirely - CI gets short-lived tokens by proving its identity. Use for all cloud access.
2. Environment-scoped secrets: production secrets should ONLY be accessible from production deployment workflows, not from PR builds
3. Secret rotation must be automated and not require pipeline changes - external vault integration enables this

**Interview one-liner:**
"I use OIDC federation (GitHub Actions -> AWS STS) eliminating stored credentials entirely, environment-scoped secrets preventing PR builds from accessing production, and HashiCorp Vault for application secrets with automated rotation - never long-lived credentials, always audited access."

# Infrastructure as Code Testing

**TL;DR** - IaC testing validates Terraform/CloudFormation/Pulumi code through static analysis (tflint, checkov), unit testing (terraform plan), integration testing (apply to test environment), and policy testing (OPA/Sentinel) - preventing misconfigurations before they reach cloud infrastructure.
---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Terraform apply to production. S3 bucket is public - data breach. Security group allows 0.0.0.0/0 SSH - compromised in hours. No tests caught it because "it's just infrastructure, not application code."
---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Infrastructure as Code testing applies software testing methodologies to infrastructure definitions, validating correctness (does it create what you intend), security (does it follow security policies), cost (will it stay within budget), and compliance (does it meet organizational standards) before provisioning actual cloud resources.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
IaC Testing Pyramid:

         /\
        /  \   Integration (apply to test env)
       /    \  - Terratest (Go), kitchen-terraform
      /------\ - Actual cloud resources created/destroyed
     /        \
    / Contract \ Policy/contract tests
   /   Tests   \ - OPA/Conftest, Sentinel, Checkov
  /-----------  \ - "No public S3", "All encrypted"
 /              \
/ Static Analysis\ - tflint, terraform validate
/   Unit Tests    \ - terraform plan (diff)
/________________  \ - Infracost (cost estimation)

Testing stages in CI:
  1. Format:   terraform fmt -check (style)
  2. Validate: terraform validate (syntax)
  3. Lint:     tflint (best practices)
  4. Security: checkov/tfsec (misconfigurations)
  5. Plan:     terraform plan (review changes)
  6. Cost:     infracost (budget impact)
  7. Policy:   OPA/Sentinel (organizational rules)
  8. Apply:    To staging first (integration test)
```

```yaml
# GitHub Actions IaC testing pipeline
jobs:
  terraform-checks:
    steps:
      - run: terraform fmt -check
      - run: terraform validate
      - run: tflint --init && tflint
