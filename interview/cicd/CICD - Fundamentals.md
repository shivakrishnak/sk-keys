# Continuous Integration

**TL;DR** - CI is the practice of developers merging code to a shared mainline frequently (at least daily), with each merge triggering automated build and test - catching integration bugs within minutes instead of days.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Developers work in isolation for weeks. At "integration day," 10 branches are merged simultaneously. Conflicts everywhere. Bugs that would have been trivial to fix 2 weeks ago are now deeply embedded. Integration takes longer than development.

**THE BREAKING POINT:**
The longer branches live in isolation, the more painful and risky merging becomes - exponentially.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Continuous Integration was created."

**EVOLUTION:**
CI started as "merge daily" (XP practice, 1999). Added automated builds (CruiseControl). Added automated tests. Now: merge to trunk multiple times daily with full pipeline validation in minutes.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently (ideally multiple times per day), each integration verified by automated build and automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

---

### ⏱️ Understand It in 30 Seconds

**One line:**
Merge small changes often, test automatically, fix failures immediately.

**One analogy:**

> CI is like proofreading every paragraph as you write vs waiting until the entire book is done. Catching a typo in one paragraph is trivial. Finding 500 typos across 300 pages is a nightmare.

**One insight:**
CI is a PRACTICE, not a tool. Jenkins/GitHub Actions enable CI, but you don't "have CI" just because you have a build server. You have CI when EVERY developer merges to mainline at least daily and broken builds are fixed within 10 minutes.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
CI workflow:
  Developer commits -> Push to mainline
    -> Pipeline triggers automatically:
      1. Checkout code
      2. Install dependencies
      3. Compile/build
      4. Run unit tests (fast, < 5 min)
      5. Run integration tests
      6. Static analysis (lint, SAST)
      7. Build artifact (Docker image, JAR)
      8. Report results

  If ANY step fails:
    -> Notification (Slack, email)
    -> Fix immediately (top priority)
    -> No new features until green

  Key metrics:
    Build time: < 10 minutes (fast feedback)
    Success rate: > 95%
    Fix time: < 10 minutes after detection
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. CI = merge to mainline frequently + automated build/test. It's a practice, not a tool.
2. Fast feedback is essential - if builds take 30+ minutes, developers stop waiting and stack changes, defeating the purpose
3. Broken build = team's top priority. If builds stay red, CI provides no value (it's just a notification system nobody reads)

**Interview one-liner:**
"CI means developers merge to mainline multiple times daily, each commit triggering automated build and test within 10 minutes - the key metric isn't build existence but build speed, success rate, and how fast failures are fixed."

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

[TODO: 2-4 sentences. One counterintuitive fact.
 Specific. Makes this concept permanently memorable.]

---

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: What's the difference between having a CI server and actually practicing CI?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests whether you understand CI as a discipline vs tooling.

**Answer:**
Having a CI server: Jenkins runs builds when someone remembers to merge. Builds take 45 minutes. Branches live for weeks. Broken builds stay red for days. This is NOT CI.

Practicing CI:

- Developers merge to mainline at least daily (not weekly feature branches)
- Build completes in < 10 minutes (fast feedback loop)
- Broken build is fixed within 10 minutes (team's top priority)
- Tests are comprehensive enough that green build = safe to release
- Nobody starts new work on a red build

Maturity indicators:

- How long do branches live? (< 1 day = good CI)
- How fast does the build run? (< 10 min = healthy)
- How often is the build red? (> 5% = problem)
- How fast is red fixed? (> 10 min = not practicing CI)

# Continuous Delivery

**TL;DR** - Continuous Delivery ensures software is always in a releasable state by extending CI with automated deployment pipeline stages (integration testing, staging, approval gates), so releasing to production is a business decision, not a technical challenge.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Code passes CI but releasing takes a week of manual steps: build release candidate, run manual regression tests, create change request, schedule maintenance window, SSH to servers, deploy, verify. Releases are rare, risky, and stressful.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Continuous Delivery was created."

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach where teams keep software in a deployable state throughout its lifecycle, enabling deployment to production at any time through a series of automated stages (build, test, staging, approval) with one-click or scheduled releases.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Continuous Delivery pipeline:
  Commit -> Build -> Unit Tests -> Integration Tests
    -> Deploy to Staging -> Acceptance Tests
      -> [Manual Approval Gate]
        -> Deploy to Production

Key difference from Continuous Deployment:
  CD (Delivery):    Every commit CAN go to prod
                    (human clicks "deploy")
  CD (Deployment):  Every commit DOES go to prod
                    (no human gate)

Pipeline requirements:
  1. Everything in version control (code + infra + config)
  2. Automated testing at every stage
  3. Deployment is one-click (or one-command)
  4. Same artifact moves through all environments
  5. Environment parity (staging mirrors production)
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Continuous Delivery = always releasable + one-click deploy. The deploy button exists and works - it just requires human decision to press it.
2. Same artifact (Docker image, JAR) moves through ALL environments - never rebuild for production (ensures what you tested is what you deploy)
3. Key enabler: comprehensive automated testing. If you can't trust green build = releasable, you don't have CD.

**Interview one-liner:**
"Continuous Delivery means every commit passes through automated build, test, and staging validation, producing a production-ready artifact that can be deployed with one click - the release is a business decision, not a technical hurdle, enabled by environment parity and comprehensive automated testing."

# Continuous Deployment

**TL;DR** - Continuous Deployment automatically deploys every code change that passes the full pipeline to production without human intervention - requiring exceptional test coverage, feature flags, and observability to be safe.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT (given you already have Continuous Delivery):**
The manual approval gate becomes a bottleneck. Changes batch up waiting for approval. The person approving doesn't actually verify anything meaningful - it's just ceremony. Releases are "safe" but slow.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically releasing every code change to production after it passes all stages of the automated deployment pipeline, without requiring manual approval. It requires high confidence in automated testing, observability, and rapid rollback capabilities.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Continuous Deployment pipeline:
  Commit -> Build -> Unit Tests -> Integration Tests
    -> Deploy to Staging -> Automated Acceptance Tests
      -> Progressive Rollout to Production
        -> Automated Verification (metrics, errors)
          -> Full rollout OR automatic rollback

Safety mechanisms:
  1. Feature flags (deploy != release)
  2. Canary deployment (1% -> 10% -> 50% -> 100%)
  3. Automated rollback on error rate spike
  4. Observability (golden signals)
  5. Comprehensive test suites (unit + integration +
     contract + e2e)

Who does this:
  Netflix, Amazon, Google, Etsy, Facebook
  Amazon deploys every 11.7 seconds
  Netflix: 1000s of deployments per day

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Continuous Deployment = no human gate. Every passing commit goes to production automatically. Requires exceptional testing and observability.
2. Deploy != Release. Feature flags decouple deployment (code in production) from release (users see it). This makes continuous deployment safe.
3. Prerequisites: >95% test coverage, automated rollback, canary deployments, feature flags, monitoring with alerts

**Interview one-liner:**
"Continuous Deployment removes the human approval gate - every commit that passes automated testing is deployed to production automatically via progressive rollout with automated rollback on metric degradation, made safe by feature flags (deploy != release), comprehensive testing, and observability."

# Pipeline Stages

**TL;DR** - A CI/CD pipeline consists of sequential/parallel stages (build, test, scan, deploy) that progressively increase confidence through faster-then-slower feedback loops, failing fast on cheap checks before expensive ones.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
All checks run sequentially in random order. E2E tests run before unit tests (wasting 20 minutes before catching a typo). Security scans happen after deployment. No structure means slow feedback and missed issues.

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Pipeline stages are ordered phases of a CI/CD pipeline that a code change must pass through, designed with progressive confidence: fast/cheap checks first (lint, compile), then unit tests, integration tests, security scans, and finally deployment with verification.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Optimal pipeline stage ordering:

Stage 1: Commit (< 2 min)
  - Lint / format check
  - Compile
  - Unit tests (mocked, fast)

Stage 2: Integration (< 10 min)
  - Integration tests (real DB, cache)
  - Contract tests (API compatibility)
  - SAST (static security analysis)

Stage 3: Acceptance (< 20 min)
  - Deploy to staging
  - Smoke tests
  - Performance baseline check
  - DAST (dynamic security scan)

Stage 4: Release (< 5 min)
  - Deploy to production (canary)
  - Health check verification
  - Metric comparison
  - Progressive rollout / rollback

Parallel where possible:
  Stage 1: [lint] [compile] [unit-test] (parallel)
  Stage 2: [integration] [contract] [SAST] (parallel)

Fail fast principle:
  Lint fails in 30 seconds -> don't run 15-min tests
  Unit test fails in 2 min -> don't deploy to staging
```

3. Each stage gates the next - if unit tests fail, don't waste time on integration tests or staging deployment

**Interview one-liner:**
"I design pipelines with progressive confidence - fast checks first (lint, compile, unit tests under 5 min), then integration and security scans, then staging deployment with acceptance tests - parallelizing independent stages and failing fast before expensive operations."

# Branching Strategy

**TL;DR** - Branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based) define how teams use branches to manage parallel development, releases, and hotfixes - with simpler strategies (trunk-based) enabling faster delivery and less merge pain.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Everyone commits to main directly with no coordination. Or everyone creates long-lived branches with complex merge ceremonies. No shared convention means merge conflicts, broken builds, and release confusion.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Three main strategies:

1. Git Flow (complex, release-oriented):
   main ------*---------*-------> (releases)
   develop --*-*-*-*--*-*------> (integration)
   feature/x --*--*--/           (short-lived)
   release/1.0 ----*-/           (stabilization)
   hotfix/bug ---*/              (emergency)

   Use when: packaged software, versioned releases,
             multiple versions in production

2. GitHub Flow (simple, CD-oriented):
   main ------*---*---*---*----> (always deployable)
   feature/x --*--*-/           (short PR branches)

   Use when: web apps, continuous deployment,
             single version in production

3. Trunk-Based Development:
   main/trunk *-*-*-*-*-*-*---> (everyone commits here)
   (optional short-lived branches < 1 day)

   Use when: high-performing teams, CI/CD mature,
             feature flags available

Comparison:
  | Strategy    | Branch life | Complexity | Deploy speed |
  |-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
  | Git Flow    | Weeks       | High       | Slow         |
  | GitHub Flow | Days        | Medium     | Fast         |
  | Trunk-Based | Hours       | Low        | Fastest      |
```

**If you remember only 3 things:**

1. Trunk-Based = highest CI/CD velocity (merge to main multiple times daily). Git Flow = slowest but handles multiple release versions.
2. Long-lived branches are the #1 enemy of continuous integration - the longer a branch lives, the more painful and risky the merge
3. For most modern web/SaaS teams: GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based. Git Flow only for teams shipping versioned packages.

**Interview one-liner:**
"I prefer trunk-based development for SaaS products - short-lived branches (< 1 day), feature flags for incomplete work, and continuous deployment from main. Git Flow is appropriate only when maintaining multiple release versions simultaneously."

# Trunk-Based Development

**TL;DR** - Trunk-Based Development is a branching model where all developers commit to a single shared branch (trunk/main) multiple times per day, using feature flags to hide incomplete work - enabling the fastest CI/CD flow.

---

### 🔥 The Problem This Solves

**WORLD WITHOUT IT:**
Feature branches live for weeks. Merging becomes a multi-day event. Integration bugs appear late. Release branches diverge. Teams spend more time managing branches than writing features.

**THE INVENTION MOMENT:**
"This is exactly why Trunk-Based Development was created."

---

### 📘 Textbook Definition

Trunk-Based Development is a source-control branching model where developers merge small, frequent updates to a core trunk (main). Optional short-lived feature branches (< 1 day) are used only for code review, with feature flags controlling visibility of incomplete features in production.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Trunk-Based Development:
  main: *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-> (always deployable)
        ^   ^   ^   ^
        |   |   |   |
        Alice Bob Carol Dave (multiple commits/day)

  Short-lived branch (optional, for PR review):
  main: *-*-*---*-*-*->
             \-*/
         (branch lives < 1 day, 1 commit or small PR)

How incomplete features ship:
  if (featureFlags.isEnabled("new-checkout")) {
    return newCheckoutFlow();
  }
  return existingCheckoutFlow();

  Code is IN production but not VISIBLE to users
  Until the flag is enabled (for 1%, 10%, 100%)

Prerequisites:
  1. Feature flags (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, custom)
  2. Fast CI pipeline (< 10 min for full validation)
  3. Comprehensive automated tests
  4. Team discipline (small commits, never break trunk)
  5. Code review on short-lived PRs (same day merge)
```

2. Enables highest deploy frequency - Google, Meta, Netflix all use trunk-based development
3. Requires: fast CI, feature flags, test discipline, and small incremental commits (not big-bang feature drops)

"Trunk-based development maximizes CI/CD flow - all developers commit to main multiple times daily, incomplete features hidden behind flags, with short-lived branches only for code review. This requires fast CI (< 10 min), comprehensive tests, and disciplined small commits."

### 💡 The Surprising Truth

[TODO: 2-4 sentences. One counterintuitive fact.
 Specific. Makes this concept permanently memorable.]

---

### 🎯 Interview Deep-Dive

**Q1: How do you handle a feature that takes 3 weeks to build with trunk-based development?**

_Why they ask:_ Tests practical application of the model.

**Answer:**
Techniques for large features:

1. **Feature flags**: Deploy code incrementally behind a flag. Each small commit adds a piece. Flag stays off until feature is complete.
2. **Branch by abstraction**: Create abstraction layer, implement new version behind it, switch over when ready. Old and new coexist.
3. **Dark launching**: Deploy the new code path, route a copy of traffic to it (shadow mode), verify correctness without user impact.
4. **Incremental delivery**: Break 3-week feature into 10 independently-shippable pieces that each add value.

Example: Rebuilding checkout flow (3 weeks)

- Day 1-3: New checkout service behind flag (empty shell)
- Day 4-7: Add payment processing to new service
- Day 8-10: Add address validation
- Day 11-14: Shadow mode (real traffic, compare results)
- Day 15: Enable flag for 1% of users (canary)
- Day 16-18: Ramp to 100%
- Day 19-21: Remove old checkout code and flag

Key: at no point does main become undeployable. Every commit is production-safe.
